# Introduction

When the soon-to-be-defunct startup of a friend closed down one of its labs, he was allowed to 
take a few toys home. Part of the loot were 2 HP 33120A 15MHz function/arbitrary waveform 
generators.

[![Keysight 33120A Datasheet Header](/assets/hp33120a/keysight_datasheet_header.jpg)](/assets/hp33120a/keysight_datasheet.pdf)

They used to be pretty popular, and you can often find them second hand on
eBay or Craiglist for around $250. That doesn't mean that they're exceptional instruments.
The [datasheet](/assets/hp33120a/keysight_datasheet.pdf) praises a straightforward and
intuitive front-panel user interface that gets often ridiculed by actual users.
They only have a 12-bit DAC and a sampling rate of 40MSa/s, the specs for
phase noise, harmonics, rise time are underwhelming, and one channel per unit 
can be a limitation too.  But at least there's a GPIB and an RS-232 interface to create 
[automated test and measurement setups](/2020/06/07/Making-Sense-of-Test-and-Measurement-Protocols.html).

A quick look at the Siglent website shows that a 2 channel 30MHz 
[SDG1032X](https://siglentna.com/waveform-generators/sdg1000x-series-functionarbitrary-waveform-generators/)
exceed the 33120A for every feature, for $359. So there's really not good reason to buy 
a second hand 33120A, unless you have a legacy automated setup that requires one.

But enough about its relative deficiencies, they're still a nice piece of kit for a home
lab, especially when acquired for free.

One day while he was cleaning up his garage, I passed by and saw the two units sitting
there on a shelve in the dust. I've never had a use for a signal generator (does
anyone ever?), but I love to play with test equipment just for the fun of it, so I
borrowed them and took them home. That was 2 years ago.

After powering them up, it was quickly clear than only one of them was working correctly,
sending out the default 1kHz 100Vpp sine wave.  The other one had a 1kHz square wave signal 
on the SYNC output, but the main output was dead. 

![Oscilloscope and 2 33120A](/assets/hp33120a/oscilloscope_and_2_hp33120a.jpg)

It was time to open the, up and have a look inside!

# Opening Up an HP 33120A

I alomost feel embarassed to post instructions on how to open up a 33120A: it's just too
simple. But I've overdone it for other devices, so let's just get it over with...

There's a grand total of 3 Torx T15 screws:

![Back view with 2 screws](/assets/hp33120a/back_view.jpg)

![Bottom view with 1 screw](/assets/hp33120a/bottom_view.jpg)

After that, you can slide off the enclosure, as long as you've already removed the handle. 

[![Top view inside](/assets/hp33120a/top_view_inside_small.jpg)](/assets/hp33120a/top_view_inside.jpg)
*(Click to enlarge)*

There's a large number of integrated circuits on the left, but towards the front, there's
plenty of small individual analog components such as transistors, resistors and capacitors
as well. That's good, because those are much easier to replace.

When you click on that top view picture, you'll get a high resolution version.
Go ahead and check out if you can see anything interesting. We'll come back to that later.

# A Walk Through the Block Diagram

The [service manual](/assets/hp33120a/HP_33120A_Function_Generator_Service.pdf) is excellent, with 
an extensive section dedicated to theory of operation and full schematics. My only minor
complaints are that the component annotation in the schematics isn't PDF searchable, and that
the component list has ranges like this: C714-C719, which means that a search for, say, C716
won't turn up anything. 

The block diagram is split up 11 sections. Each section is a major functional block, and 
a separate schematic page as well. What I absolutely *love* is that the leading number of
components is the section number as well. In other words, if you're looking at the PCB
and see resistor R723, you know right away that it's part of section 7, the output
amplifier. It's a huge time saver when trying to match a component against a schematic.

[![HP 33120A Block Diagram](/assets/hp33120a/block_diagram.png)](/assets/hp33120a/block_diagram.png)
*(Click to enlarge.)*

You can safely [skip to the next section](#bug-hunting) if you're not interested in the architecture
of a 33120A.

The different sections have the following functionatily:

1. Floating Logic

    This section contains a small microcomputer built around an 80C196 microcontroller,
    256KB of ROM, 32KB of RAM, and 128KB of flash memory. It's responsible for managing
    the signal generating functions.

    Like the rest of the signal generating functions, it has a floating ground which allows
    a user to connect the ground of the output to any reference point they want.

    The controller has a serial link to the IO controller that's responsible for all
    control interactions with the outside world. (See below.) The serial link goes
    through opto-couplers because the IO controller uses an earth referenced ground.

2. Digital Waveform Data Synthesis

    The 33120A uses a pretty standard and straightforward way to generated signals:
    it has a RAM with waveform data and fetches waveform values from this RAM,
    skipping from one address to the next based on the selected output frequency.

    It also has support for AM, FM and FSK modulation. 

    This section contains an ASIC that generates that addresses that must be fetched
    from the main waveform RAM, and also generates that signal that will be used
    for AM: you'd think that amplitude modulation is done in the digital domain, but
    it's actually done with an analog multiplier.

3. System DAC

    We're deviating from the main pipeline for a moment. The System DAC
    generates all kinds of mostly static control voltages that will be used
    in the analog pipeline. Things like the DC offset voltage of the
    output signal, etc.

4. Waveform DAC

    This block fetches data values from a waveform RAM and applies it to a DAC.
    The DAC always runs at 40MHz, irrespective of the desired output frequency
    of the signal that must be generated.

    The amplitude of the signal that comes out of the DAC can be controlled with
    a range of only +-2dB. Further amplitude control is performed later in the
    pipeline.

5.  Filters

    Now fully in the analog domain, some serious amount of filtering is needed to get
    rid of anti-aliasing effects. Sine and square waves are going through a steep 9th order
    filter, the rest goes through a 7th order filter.

6. Sync, Square Wave and Attenuator

    An attenuator in this block reduced the amplitude with 2dB steps but only down to -14dB,
    which is why it's call the pre-attenuator.

    There's also a SYNC generator, and a square wave generator which are created by
    using a comparator opamp against the signal that comes out of the filter block.

7. Output Amplifier

    The output amplifier amplifies the signal by a fixed factor of 10 and also adds
    a fixed offset. It's designed to drive a 50Ohm load.

8. Output Attenuator

    The main attenuator can reduce the signal from 0dB to -30dB with, again, steps of 2dB.

    There are 4 stages with roughly double the attenuation that can be switched in and out
    of the main signal path.

9. Earth Referenced Logic

    This section contains the IO controller that takes care of the frontpanel user interface,
    the RS232 serial port, the GPIB interface and a beeper.

10. Power Supply

    There are 5 main voltages: +5V, -5.2V, +18V, -18V, and +5V.

    There are 2 +5V rails because one is for the floating ground electronics and the
    other is for the earth referenced ground.

11. Display and Keyboard

    Like all the HP instruments of its day, the 33120A uses a vacuum fluorescent display (VFD).
    These have a tendency to fade over time and replacment parts are often very pricey.

    On my units, they are in fantastic shape.

# Bug Hunting

If you tried to look for something interesting in the previous picture, chances are
that you noticed the area that's marked in red:

[![Burnt PCB](/assets/hp33120a/burnt_section_small.jpg)](/assets/hp33120a/burnt_section.jpg)
*(Click to enlarge)*

You can't quite see it on the broken device but capacitor C717 has completely disappeared 
and there's a very clear burn mark. That's not good. In addition to the burnt area, 
we can also see that there is heavy PCB discoloration around components C707, CR703 
(a 3.3V Zener diode), and R706.

This section of the PCB is part of the output amplifier. The DAC produces a positive and
a negative version of the signal, and these 2 signals get passed through all the way to the
output amplifier. There is a strong top/bottom symmetry in both the schematic and the PCB,
and almost every component exists twice.

For example, the 9 components in the red area are present in the blue area as well. Even
if we didn't have the schematic, this would have been very useful to determine if certain
components had been damaged, and what kind of value they were.

But we have the schematics, and they show that Zener CR704 creates -15V from the -18V
rail, and that C707 and C717 are decoupling caps on this -15V rail.

![CR704 and C717](/assets/hp33120a/CR704_C717.png)

# Zener Replacement

If you're trying to do electronics repair, you should always check power rails first. A
quick check on the CR704 pins showed that the -18V rail was fine, but the -15V rail was not.

So we have a burn scar, a missing (vaporized?) decoupling cap, and a broken Zener. This
now becomes a cause-and-effect problem. Did the Zener break because of the heat, or did
heat develop because of a defective Zener? During extensive probing, I didn't notice any
magic smoke coming out of the burnt area, so I assumed that the Zener was the cause of it
all.

Either way, it had to be replaced, so I ordered an 
[Onsemi 1SMB5913BT3G](https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/_onsemi-_C53169.html) at LCSC.

![Zener on LCSC](/assets/hp33120a/zener_lcsc.png)

See that "0 In Stock"? At the time, LCSC was the only place where I was able to find
such a Zener. DigiKey had, and still has, nothing available.

*That was in April 2021. I lost interest in the repair and picked it back up 20
months later in December 2022.*

Replacing the Zener was uneventful...

![Zener soldering](/assets/hp33120a/zener_soldering.jpg)

... but while the -15V rail was now reading the right voltage, the output of the function
generator was still a flat line.

# Staring at the Eye of Sauron

I once again started probing all around the PCB to check if anything else might be wrong.

*Tip: if you're probing a live circuit with an oscilloscope and you set the impedance at
50 Ohm, you'll get really weird results...*

I did this for at least 15 uneventful minutes when sudden it was staring at the Eye
of Sauron:

![The Eye of Sauron](/assets/hp33120a/the_eye_of_sauron.gif)

I've seen magic smoke in the past, but this things was glowing red hot! The smoke
of burnt FR4 material lingered in my lungs for the rest of the day. I had my
priorities straight and took a picture first before shutting down power.

There was clearly some kind of short inside the PCB, though it's unclear why it took
a while to show up. The chances of a successful repair were not looking great.

# FLIR IR Imaging

How do you get rid of a short inside a PCB? You use a drill to remove the piece with
the short entirely, and then you try to reconstruct the collateral damage.

But before you can do that, it's best if you have a good idea about the exact location
of the defect, and whether or not you have actually fixed it. This is where IR imaging
comes in really handly.

I have a friend who owns an FLIR IR camera module. It's not a full camera, but an
extension that can be plugged into the iPhone lightning connector:

![FLIR IR Camera](/assets/hp33120a/FLIR_camera.jpg)

At around $300, these things are not cheap, but they're amazing.

Here's what happened in IR when I switched the 33120A on again:

<iframe width="539" height="959" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gMF69v8_RvY" title="PCB immediately heating up" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This time, it heated up immediately. This, at least, makes it much easier to verify
whether or not the issue is gone.

With a working unit in hand, I could take an IR picture to use as a reference signature
image and check how things should look when everything is fixed.

The FLIR camera overlays the IR image with the non-IR image, but the iPhone lens and
the FLIR module lens are on the opposite side of the phone, and not aligned along the 
same axis. The FLIR software has an image shift function to correct for this, but only
along 1 axis. 

In the picture below, the green rectangle shows the Zener diode in non-IR. The
corresponding IR image is in red. We can see the the Zener heats
up to a temperature of roughly 52C, or a bit more because I didn't quite hit the
warmest spot:

# To Destroy a PCB in Order to Save It

It just feel wrong to use a Dremel tool to drill a hole in something
you're supposed to repair, but here we are. There weren't really
any other options.

![Drilling a hole with a Dremel](/assets/hp33120a/dremel_drilling.jpg)

Here's the situation after the first drill:

![PCB after first drill](/assets/hp33120a/pcb_after_first_drill.jpg)

I drilled right above where C717 used to be, trying not to cut into the
connections of R706.

The IR image after the first drill is much improved, but there's still
a 79C hotspot that I didn't think should be there:

![IR image after first drill](/assets/hp33120a/ir_after_first_drill.jpg)

You can't see the drill hole in the image above because I was using ceramic
non-conductive(!) tweezers to better get my bearings on the IR image.

Since the hotspot was to the top-right of the drill hole, I decided to
enlarge the hole in that direction. There was a high chance that I'd 
destroy the connection to the left of R708 in the process, but so be it.
I did desolder R708 first because I didn't have a spare 196 Ohm resistor in my
component box.

Here's the situation after the second drill: 

![PCB after second drill](/assets/hp33120a/pcb_after_second_drill.jpg)

The hole now almost touches the left pad of R708.

![IR image after second drill](/assets/hp33120a/ir_after_second_drill.jpg)

* You can clearly see the IR hole: when there's nothing there, there's nothing to warm up. 
* There's no 79C hotspot anymore at the top right of the hole. That's great: the
  short seems to be completely gone now!
* The Zener doesn't warm up. That can be easily be explained by the drilling:
  if the hole has cut off the -15V rail to the rest of the components, then
  no current can flow and there's thus nothing to warm up.

After soldering R708 back, the IR image stayed the same. 

# Circuit Reconstruction

It was no surprise that the generator still didn't output anything: some
signals were destroyed and needed to be rebuilt. First step is to figure out
what was broken. As reasonable assumption was that the broken signals
would go to the nearby components. 

With the help of my working 33120A, the schematic, and a bunch of probing
with a multimeter, I ended up with the following interconnections:

[![PCB annotated with component interconnections](/assets/hp33120a/reference_local_components_annotated.jpg)](/assets/hp33120a/reference_local_components_annotated.jpg)
*(Click to enlarge)*

After measuring things on the drilled PCB, the only missing connections
were the -15V rail for R708 and R749!

I didn't not have a 2.2uF C717 replacement, but since that's just a decoupling
cap that sits in parallel with the much larger C707, it shouldn't prevent the
signal generator from generating a signal. The only potential impact might
be a slight reduction in noise performance.

![PCB with wire patches](/assets/hp33120a/PCB_after_fixes.jpg)

After the earlier drama, the reconstruction of the PCB is a bit of
an anti-climax with just 2 wires.

Ohm-ing out the remaining connections didn't show anything else missing. 
Even the connection left of the capacitor that's sitting between R708
and R723 turned out to be fine.

# Success!

Next up was the moment of truth: would the thing work now? It did!

![Oscilloscope with repaired unit](/assets/hp33120a/Oscilloscope_with_repaired_unit.jpg)

Such a rush!

# Trust but Verify

All that was left was to check if everything was truly fixed.

The IR image is exactly as it should be, with the Zener at
56C, very close to the 52C that I measured on the working unit.

![IR image after fix](/assets/hp33120a/ir_after_fix.jpg)

I also checked the signal quality by sending the output
of the reference and the repaired unit to a spectrum analyzer and comparing
the difference:

![Spectrum analyzer comparison](/assets/hp33120a/spectrum_comparison.jpg)

The image above shows the spectrum of a 10kHz sine wave and its harmonics
up to 100kHz. Green is the result of the reference unit, yellow the
repaired one. If you only see a few pixels of green, that's because the
yellow and green are overlapping almost perfectly.

I did a number of tests at different frequencies and with different waveforms:
the 2 units always performed the same.

# Conclusion

After this journey, I can officially retire the Broken label and replace
with with Repaired.

![Unit broken](/assets/hp33120a/unit_broken.jpg)

![Unit repaired](/assets/hp33120a/unit_repaired.jpg)

The reference unit will eventually go back to the original owner, once he
has a bit more space in his garage. He decided to give the repaired unit
to me, so I'm now the happy owner of a signal generator. Maybe one day I'll find
a good use for it!

I would never sell the unit on eBay though. While the repair has been 
successful, I don't think I'd ever trust the device enough to keep it
permanently on in some kind of automated test setup. If a PCB can develop
an internal short once, it could always happen a second time? I don't want
the liability of that happening to somebody else.

I totally loved the FLIR camera. I personally don't do enough repair work 
to justify the $300 expense, but I can see this as an essential tool for
anyone who does. The ability to see unusual stuff is amazing.

I don't have any broken toys in my inventory for now, so on to other things
to play with!
