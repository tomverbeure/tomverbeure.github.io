    Section 15.231 Periodic operation in the band 40.66 - 40.70 MHz and above 70 MHz. 
    (a) The provisions of this Section are restricted to periodic operation within the 
    band 40.66 - 40.70 MHz and above 70 MHz. Except as shown in paragraph (e) of this Section, 
    the intentional radiator is restricted to the transmission of a control signal such as 
    those used with alarm systems, door openers, remote switches, etc. Radio control of 
    toys is not permitted. Continuous transmissions, such as voice or video, and data 
    transmissions are not permitted. The prohibition against data transmissions does not 
    preclude the use of recognition codes. Those codes are used to identify the sensor 
    that is activated or to identify the particular component as being part of the system.
