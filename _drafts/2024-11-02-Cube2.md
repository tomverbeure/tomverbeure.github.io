# Introduction

![Pacman in the maze](/assets/cube2/pacman_in_the_maze.jpg)

More than 4 years ago, I created [my first LED cube](/2021/05/16/Pixel-Purse-LED-Cube.html). It was
a bit of a flex, using LED panels that were recovered from an ugly children's toy and controlled
by a [reverse engineered Cisco modem](/2019/11/11/Cisco-HWIC-3G-CDMA.html). 
But when I built that first cube, I already had purchased a bunch of 160mm P2.5 LED panels from AliExpress 
for what was supposed to be a smaller yet higher resolution cube. I just never got to it.

With only a month to go before Hackaday Supercon 2023, and without anything lined up to hack on,
I dug up those panels and decided to make another LED cube. This time, the goal was to get all individual 
componets ready as quickly as possible so that I could do the assembly, electronics, and software at 
the conference.

# The Components

You need the following core items for an LED cube:

* the LED panels
* a controller to drive the panels
* a power board 
* a mechanical frame 

Let's go over these aspects next.

# the LED panels

For my first LED cube, I used 12 rectangular panels with a resolution of 32x16 pixels each,
driven by a standard HUB75 interface. 32x32 pixels per side don't give you a lot to work with 
which is why I used square panels with a resolution of 64x64 pixels this time around. The LEDs 
have a pitch of 2.5mm resulting in a square size of 160mm x 160mm, significantly smaller than 
the previous cube.

![LED panel P2.5 on AliExpress](/assets/cube2/LED panel P2.5.png)

Back in 2019, the LED panels cost something like $20 a piece, but they are much cheaper
now: on a good day, I'm seeing prices on AliExpress of around $10. They're still equiped
with a HUB75 interface though the pinout may different between different suppliers: rather
than a rigid standard, HUB75 is more of an aspiration of something that resembles one. For
a one-off hobby projects, this doesn't really matter.

64x64 pixel LED panels with a pitch of 2mm exit but they used to cost signficantly more,
I remember prices of $40 a piece. However those prices have now come down to same price range as
P2.5 panels. If I ever build a third cube, it will use P2 panels. Keep in mind that a size of 
128x128mm makes it harder to squeeze all the cabling and controller board in a tight
space. It wouldn't have worked for the controller board that I'm using in this project.

The HUB75 protocol is the combination of control signals to drive R, G, and B shift registers
that go to the columns of the LED panel, and some address signals to select the row. Most
panels have an input and output connector so that multiple panels can be daisy chained.

But there's a limit to the amount of daisy chaining: on my first LED cube, the limit was
around 8 panels. The limit depends on the rate at which the shift register is operated. To
maintain the same overall refresh rate of the system, the shift register clock speed will
be proportional to the number of pixels that are connect to a single chain. My 64x64
panels have 64x64 pixels instead of 32x16, a factor of 8. This will influence the number
of HUB75 ports on the controller.

# The Colorlight 5A-75B Controller Board

A couple of years ago, [q3k](https://github.com/q3k) spent some time reverse engineering
commercial HUB75 controller cards. Most of of these cards are FPGA based, and since they are
produced at pretty high volume, you need many for large LED panel installations, they are
pretty cheap.

He created the [chubby75 project on GitHub](https://github.com/q3k/chubby75) to which other
people contributed reverse engineering information. I bought myself a Colorlight 5A-75B and helped
with the reverse engineering. 

[![Colorlight 5A-75B annotated PCB](/assets/cube2/cl-5a-75b-v61-front-annotated.jpg)](/assets/cube2/cl-5a-75b-v61-front-annotated.jpg)
*Click to enlarge*

It has a few interesting characteristics:

* it's dirt cheap. They're available on AliExpress for less than $20, including shipping.
* the FPGA is a Lattice ECP5-25 which is fully supported by the Yosys/NextPnR/Project Xray 
  opensource toolchain, which allows me to do all the development on my Macbook.
* it has through-holes exposed for a JTAG connector, right next to the FPGA. Other HUB75
  controller boards require scraping off slik-screen over vias and clumsy soldering work
  to access JTAG signals.
* there are 8 HUB75 connectors which allows my to connect all 6 LED panels without the
  need for daisy chaining.
  
One thing to be aware off: there are multiple PCB versions of this product. Version
[V6.1, V8.0 and V8.2](https://github.com/q3k/chubby75/tree/master/5a-75b) have been successfully
reverse engineered, but who knows if there are other versions out there.

The overall functionality of all versions is the same, but my V6.1 board uses a 381 ball
BGA package of the ECP5-25 while the other known boards are using the 256 ball version.

One major limitation of pretty much all HUB75 controller boards is that they don't have any
general purpose input signals to speak off. When used in their intended configuration, HUB75 
controller boards receive video content over one of their two Gbit Ethernet ports. All HUB75 
pins are output-only, with a uni-directional 75HC245 bus driver between the FPGA and the pins 
to take care of voltage level shifting from 3.3V to 5V.[^1]

It would have been great to be able to attach an IMU, microphone or some USB device to influence
the LED cube content one way or the other but that was not the scope of this project. There
was just not enough time.

# A Custom Power Board

It can take a lot of power to light up 24576 LEDs, so much so that you never actually want
to light them up at the same time. Maximum power consuption for P2.5 panels is on the order
of 700 W/m2 or roughly 18W for a 64x64 P2.5 panel. For a 6-sided cube that translates into 
a whopping 108W or 22 Amps on a 5V rail. There's no way you can fit the batteries for that 
in a small cube, but luckily you don't have to: just make sure to never light up all LEDs at maximum 
intensity at the same time.

[![Power board 3D](/assets/cube2/power_board_3d.png)](/assets/cube2/power_board_3d.png)

For this cube I decided to keep things simple and safe: 18650 battery cells for power, 
**no charging circuit**, and off-the-shelve switched power regulators, a solution that
I had already used for my LED sphere.

I settled on 4 batteries and 2 regulators, each on fed by 2 batteries. Each regulator is
supposed to power half of the LED panels, while one of them also powers the controller PCB.

The regulators are LM2596-based DC-DC buck converters: they're dirt cheap on Amazon, a set of
4 will set you back around $7. They can regulator about 3 Amps and step down an input voltage
between 3 to 40V down to 1.5V to 35V. In my case, they're stepping down ~7.5V (2 18650 cells
in series) down to ~5V.

The schematic couldn't be simpler:

[![Power board schematic](/assets/cube2/power_board_schematic.png)](/assets/cube2/power_board_schematic.png)

I use a bipolar switch to short the connection between J9-J10 and J12-J13.

Lithium batteries freak me out, especially the part where they can catch fire when overcharging.
That's why I didn't add battery charging logic and use an external charger instead. It's a bit 
clumsy to remove the batteries from the board to recharge, but it's really not so bad. 

The KiCad files for the power board can be found [here](https://github.com/tomverbeure/cube2/tree/main/pcb).

# Mechanical CAD: FreeCAD Out, Onshape In

When I built my LED ball (blog post still pending...), I spent an extraordinary amount of time
battling the many quirks and crashes of FreeCAD. We're literally talking about 100+ hours of
frustration.[^2]

[^2]: FreeCAD is well on its way to getting its first major release 1.0. I've been told things 
      are better now. One can hope.

![LED ball components](/assets/cube2/led_ball_components.jpg)

Admittedly, that project was more complicated than a cube in every possible way, but it left
me wondering whether the issue with mechanical CAD was just not for me? Or was it the tool?

![FreeCAD rendering of ball segments](/assets/cube2/ring_view_1.jpg)

For this project I didn't have the time to fight a tool ad nauseam, so I looked at alternative
options. I do my development on a mix of Linux, MacOS, and sometimes even Windows machines, and
other than FreeCAD there are not many options that support all of these. But one contender is 
[Onshape](https://www.onshape.com/en/): it runs entirely in the browser which is quite amazing
if you think about it. The 
[*Standard Plan*](https://www.onshape.com/en/pricing) 
carries a hefty $1500 per year price tag but there's also a free plan for hobbyists.

Under the free plan, all your designs are publically available but that's OK for me. 

I had heard good things about Onshape, so I gave it a try and, oh boy, what a difference compared
to FreeCAD. I spent an hour or two following some of their online tutorials to get the hang of it,
and then it was off to the races. 

According to my version history, I spent one Sunday playing with Onshape to come up with a first
design, and a week later I sent version 2 to JLCPCB to be 3D printed.

[![LED cube frame in Onshape](/assets/cube2/onshape_led_cube_frame.png)](/assets/cube2/onshape_led_cube_frame.png)
*Click to enlarge*

You can interactively check out the design in Onshape itself by clicking
[this link](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/9c6fc72c1050c20aab7ddb50/w/5c5d9526339ad15dcdb09df8/e/98a4e370f05afd76ca310a5e?renderMode=0&uiState=67273c2f0a199d6efe2b6775). How cool is that?!

It would be unfair to directly compare the number of hours that I spent on FreeCAD against the few hours
on Onshape since some of those initial hours were used to learn the fundamentals of mechanical CAD
in general: the use of sketches, parameteric design etc. But all in all I spent maybe 8 hours on Onshape 
in total. It was intuitive, it just worked, and I never experienced any crashes. The issue wasn't me, it 
was the tool after all.[^3]

[^3]: I'm well aware of the topological naming problem of FreeCAD. My issues with FreeCAD were not
      related to it.

# Mechanical Design of the Cube

![LED cube frame assembly with LED panels](/assets/cube2/assembly_with_LED_panels.png)

There are number of constraints that make the frame of an LED cube a bit harded than it seems.

Here are some considerations:

* it needs to look nice
* how to open up one of the 6 sides to access internals
* easy access to charge and/or replace batteries
* how to assemble the thing: screwing parts together, connecting cables
* structural integrity
* cost 

It's fair to say that I failed miserably at most of these points. 

* Instead of 6 or 7 flat pieces that can be assembled together into a cube frame,
  I chose a 3D printed unibody frame. This not only makes it more expensive to print ($43)
  but it also blows up the shipping cost ($47).
* I wanted to reuse the tiny (0.5mm) screwholes of my LED panels to mount them onto
  the frame. This required a 3D printing process with high precision which is why I 
  choose a more expensive SLS printing technology. And it was all for nothing because 
  even with SLS the holes didn't line up. I could only fit 1 screw on each side.

  ![Tiny screw in frame](/assets/cube2/tiny_screw_in_frame.jpg)

* SLS isn't very stiff. JLCPCB warned me about some warping before they started the print. But
  this was made worse by have a frame thickness that was too small. Because of this, there
  are gaps between the frame and the panels. It's not a huge deal, once the LEDs are
  lighting up you just don't notice it, but I could have avoided it.

  ![Frame warping](/assets/cube2/frame_warping.jpg)

* The batteries are accessible enough, but the JTAG pins of the controller board are
  buried deep inside the cube: if they ever come loose, it's kind of game over and I
  might have to disassemble the cube before I can update the FPGA bitstream ever again.

It's not all bad though: compared to plastic filaments, SLS looks great. I was about
to work about the misaligned screw issue by using... double sided tape. Someone at
Supercon '23 suggested this to me and it works great. It's so much simpler and if anything
the tape is too strong. I'll be using that a lot more for future projects.

![LED panel model](/assets/cube2/LED_panel_model.png)

The design itself and the process to get there was straightforward: I first modeled 
the LED panel itself, including various components along its perimeter to make sure that
the frame wouldn't interfere with them. It can't stress how important it is to do this:
it's so easy to lose track of things that will interfere with each other.

![Single side frame](/assets/cube2/single_side_frame.png)

In the next step, I created a single-side frame in which the panel could fit. You can
see 8 tiny little misguided holes that were intended to be used to screw down the panel.
The larger round holes can used to embed magnets so that the top LED panel can be 
removed for inside access.

![Full assembly with center diagonal PCB holder](/assets/cube2/assembly_with_pcb_holder.png)

Those 6 sides are brought together to form the cube frame. A center diagonal divider
is used to provide more structural support and to mount the controller board. I added
additional diagonal ribs perpendicular to the PCB for additional structural support,
but those were a mistake: they make it even harder to reach inside an already cramped 
space and they're also just not necessary: it turns out that square PCBs on 6 sides
of a cube are really good at creating a solid structure. 

The center diagonal holds 2 PCBs: on one side the Colorlight 5A-75B, for which dimensions
and mounting hole locations are available from the manufacturer, and a custom power
board PCB on the other. I created the power PCB outline with mountain holes in Onshape
and then imported it into KiCAD for layout. 

![Full assembly with power PCB](/assets/cube2/assembly_with_power_pcb.png)

The 3D printed frame arrived a good week before the start of Supercon '23. A quick check of 
the different parts showed that the overall design was sound. The real work would have
to happen at the conference.

# Assembly at Supercon '23

Armed with a suitcase full of components and tools I was ready to start assembly.

![Items at start of assembly](/assets/cube2/assembly_start.jpg)

The Friday of Supercon is nothing but tons of people in a tight space hacking on
the conference badge or on their own project. It creates an environment with tons
of distractions, but that's a big part of the fun. Still, after an hour or so I had
the power board soldered and up and running.

![Power board is alive](/assets/cube2/power_board_alive.jpg)

Many hours later, I finally had the panels lighting up a solid color.

![Panels lighting up](/assets/cube2/panels_lighting_up.jpg)

The cube gets very cramped when all cables are in place. It's possible to improve on
this by trimming the standard length power and HUB75 cables, but I didn't do that.
Note at the bottom right the JTAG cable that I mentioned earlier: it goes deep into 
down into the cube. After cutting out one of the diagonals that I added for structural
support, the batteries can be removed and reinstalled without major issues.

![An explosion of cables](/assets/cube2/an_explosion_of_cables.jpg)

After this, it was a matter to adapt the RTL of my first LED cube to this one. This took
much longer that I expected. Partially because I wanted to keep the RTL generic and
partially because there were a couple of really dumb bugs.

By Sunday morning, you could see a broken pacman.

Finally, about 15 minutes before closing time, Rick was dancing on screen!

![Rick's never gonna give you up](/assets/cube2/rick_dancing.jpg)

Soon after the batteries gave up too. It had been a productive 3 day weekend.

# PacMan Cubed

After Supercon '23, I spent a few more hours cleaning up some code but after that
the cube went into a box and sat in my garage for the rest of the year. Supercon
'24 was announced when were super busy at work so instead of another last-minute
rush to get something off the ground I just picked up the cube where I had left it:
a mostly completed hardware project that was in need of some software.

![Pacman not following the grid](/assets/cube2/pacman_without_rules.jpg)

It started out with PacMan endlessly looping around the cube followed by ghosts but
not following any rules of the game. The goal of the weekend was to convert it into
something that followed the game as closely as possible: getting chased by ghosts in
the maze, eating dots, chasing ghosts after each a bit dot and so forth.

This time around, I spent way more time socializing and attending presentations, but
I got to where I wanted to be. It looks amazing, even more so when you see it in person.

# The Future & Conclusion

There are 2 glaring omissions: there's no audio and no external control of PacMan. It would
be a ton of fun to challenge people at Supercon into a multiplayer PacMan game running
around the cube. It will have to wait for next year, maybe?

Another current flaw is that the playing field doesn't extend to the top and bottom LED
panels. That's just a software problem. I'll get to that eventually.

This was another fun if long-running project. I learned Onshape, I submitted my first
3D print job to JLCPCB and learned a thing or two about manufacturability. And I had 
a great conversation starter at Supercon.
