# Introduction

In [my blog post about Reed-Solomon coding](/2022/08/07/Reed-Solomon.html), 
I used regular integers for all calculations.  These are unpractical for a real-world 
implementation, but since everybody knows integers math since first grade, it made things 
easier to learn things one step at a time.

Instead of working with pure integers, actual Reed-Solomon implementations will
use elements from a [Galois or Finite field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field) 
as symbols.

In this blog post, I will first talk a bit about Galois fields. I will rely heavily on 
examples instead of 

Not nearly enough to
have a solid theoretical understanding, just sufficiently so that I can refer back to
it when I've forgotten some of the details. You can find much better material online if 
you want to get a better understanding. Check out in the [References](#references) section
below from a bunch of links.

Once these basics are out of the way, I'll dive into some details related to hardware
implementation of Galois field multipliers.

# Galois Field

In mathematic, a field is a set of elements for which addition, subtraction, multiplication
and division operations have been defined, with propertes that are the same the ones
that we take for granted when dealing with rational or real numbers, such as the associative
and distributive properties.

A Galois field is a field that has a limited number of elements, but that still has
these kind of operations and properties.

A good example of a Galois field is GF(5). It has the integer numbers 0 to 4 as elements.
Addition, subtraction, and multiplicaiton work the same as for regular integers, except that each such operation 
is followed by a modulo 5 operation. Division is defined as a multiplication by the inverse:

$$ \frac{a}{b} = a \cdot b^{-1} $$

Here are a few example operations in GF(5):

$$
\begin{align}
1 + 3 = (1+3) \bmod 5 = 4 \bmod 5 = 4     \\
2 + 7 = (2+6) \bmod 5 = 8 \bmod 5 = 3     \\
3 \cdot 4 = (3 \cdot 4) \bmod 5 = 36 \bmod 5 = 1     \\
\end{align}
$$

**Division**

Division is a bit less intuitive: we need the multiplicative inverse of the divisor, which can be
found by checking all possible element. Let's say we want to do 2/3 in GF(5). 3 is the divisor. 
We need to find $$3^{-1}$$ so that $$3 \cdot 3^{-1} = 1$$. 

There are 5 different options 0,1,2,3,4.

$$
\begin{align}
(3 \cdot 0) \bmod 5 = 0 \\
(3 \cdot 1) \bmod 5 = 3 \\
(3 \cdot 2) \bmod 5 = 1 \\
(3 \cdot 3) \bmod 5 = 4 \\
(3 \cdot 4) \bmod 5 = 2 \\
\end{align}
$$

We can see that $$(3 \cdot 2)\bmod 5 = 1$$, so $$3^{-1}=2$$. 

And thus:

$$2/3 = (2 \cdot 2) \bmod 5 = 4$$

**A Prime Number of Elements**

One thing to note is that the number of elements in a Galois field must always be a
a prime number. This is because the division operation would otherwise be ill defined.

For example, let's try to find the multiplicative inverse of 2 when doing a modulo 6 operation:

$$
\begin{align}
(2 \cdot 0) \bmod 6 = 0 \\
(2 \cdot 1) \bmod 6 = 2 \\
(2 \cdot 2) \bmod 6 = 4 \\
(2 \cdot 3) \bmod 6 = 0 \\
(2 \cdot 4) \bmod 6 = 2 \\
(2 \cdot 5) \bmod 6 = 4 \\
\end{align}
$$

There's no solution with a result of 1. Since there's at least one element for which a
multiplicative inverse doesn't exist, GF(6) can't be a field.

**Real World Example of a Galois Field**

Since a Galois field must have a prime number of elements, only GF(2) can map directly
to the zeros and ones of digital logic. All other fields will have an odd number of elements.
But that doesn't mean that there aren't any real-world cases where these kind of Galois
fields are used: the [Wikipedia article on Reed-Solomon error correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reedâ€“Solomon_error_correction#Error_locator_polynomial)
has an example that uses GF(929), a field that is used for coding [PD417](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF417)
bar codes.

![PD417 bar code](/assets/reed_solomon/Wikipedia_PDF417.png)<br/>
*&copy; [Markus.Jungbauer - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF417#/media/File:Wikipedia_PDF417.png)*

Modulo 929 calculations are fine for bar codes, where you only need to process a few per 
second at most. But they're not something you'd want to use for high speed communication
protocols that run at rates of gigabits or bytes per second. 

**GF(2)**

Before taking the next step, let's first look at the only basic operation that does map
neatly to ones and zeros: GF(2). The binary Galois field only has 2 symbols: 0 and 1.

It has the following addition table:

$$
\begin{align}
(0 + 0) \bmod 2 = 0 \\
(0 + 1) \bmod 2 = 1 \\
(1 + 0) \bmod 2 = 1 \\
(1 + 1) \bmod 2 = 0 \\
\end{align}
$$

And this is the multiplication table:

$$
\begin{align}
(0 \cdot 0) \bmod 2 = 0 \\
(0 \cdot 1) \bmod 2 = 0 \\
(1 \cdot 0) \bmod 2 = 0 \\
(1 \cdot 1) \bmod 2 = 1 \\
\end{align}
$$

Addition maps to a XOR and multiplication to an AND gate! Another property of note is that
subtraction is the same as addition. 

These are promising properties for a hardware implementation.

# Galois Field Extensions

The Galois fields discussed in the previous section, constructed out of a single prime number, are sometimes 
called base Galois fields. It turns out that you can create new Galois fields, called Galois field extensions,
out of a base Galois field by grouping multiple base elements together into an ordered tuple.

The notation for a Galois field extension is as follows: $$\text{GF}(p^n)$$, where $$p$$ is the base
prime number, and $$n$$ is the order of the extended Galois field.  The total number of elements
in an extended Galois field is $$p^n$$.

For example, $$\text{GF}(2^4)$$ is a Galois field for which  each element consists of an ordered tuple 
$$(a_3, a_2, a_1, a_0)$$ of 4 $$\text{GF}(2)$$ elements.  The total number of elements of this field is 16. 

*You'll sometimes see this written a $$\text{GF}(16)$$, which isn't ambiguous since all the factors 
of 16 are 2, so there's only 1 prime number possible, but my personal preference is to always write 
it down as $$\text{GF}(2^4)$$.*

**Extended Galois Field Addition**

All Galois fields require addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operation. For Galois
field extensions, we turn to polynomials to define these operations.

The elements within each tuple are mapped to  coefficients of a polynomial:

$$(a_3, a_2, a_1, a_0) \rightarrow a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0$$

Addition of 2 tuples becomes a polynomial addition:

$$
\begin{align}
(a_3, a_2, a_1, a_0) + (b_3, b_2, b_1, b_0)  \\
\rightarrow (a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0) + (b_3 x^3 + b_2 x^2 + b_1 x + b_0) \\
\rightarrow (a_3+b_3) x^3 + (a_2 + b_2) x^2 + (a_1 + b_1) x + (a_0 + b_0)
\end{align}
$$

Notice how, for addition, the polynomial order of the result remains the same: addition of
2 elements of an extended Galois field automatically still belong to the same Galois field.

**Extended Galois Field Multiplication**

For multiplication, we also use polynomial multiplication, but with an additional
step: pure multiplication would result in polynomials of an order that doesn't always fall
within the order of the multiplicatoin operands, which violates the requirement for
a field. We can fix this by following each multipication with division with a so called
*primitive polynomial* $$p(x)$$ and only retaining the remainder, just like we did for base Galois 
fields, where we applied a modulo operation to keep the results in check.

**Primitive Polynomial**

There are some requirements to primitive polynomial $$p(x)$$. One of the most important ones
is that it needs to be irreducible, with coefficients of the base Galois field. An
irreducible polynomial can not be factored into multiple lower order polynomials.

*Note the similarity here with base Galois fields, where the modulo operation must be
done with a prime number, one that can not be factored into multiple smaller integer.*

A primitive polynomial defines how Galois field calculations behave, so standardized
protocols always specify which primitive polynomial to use. If you want to use your own
coding protocol, you could try to find a primitive polynomial yourself, but it's much easier 
to just select one from one of tables that can be found online.

Computers work with bytes. Many protocols use the $$\text{GF}(2^8)$$ field,
so that a byte can be directly mapped to a tuple of size 8. One of the most used
primitive polynomials for $$\text{GF}(2^8)$$ is

$$p(x) = x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + 1$$

It is so popular that modern CPU ISA have instructions to perform Galois field operations 
specifically for this primitive polynomial. The Rijndael algorithm, the basis for AES encryption,
uses this polynomial. It is also used for Reed-Solomon coding in the CCSDS standard for space 
communication. And many others.

**Extended Galois Field Elements**

We now know that elements of an extended Galois field are tuples, and now to perform
operations on them, but some details of what those elements looks like. 

Let's use $$\text{GF}(2^4)$$ as an example, with $$p(x)=x^4+x+1$$ as primitive polynomial.
The field contains 16 elements. We need a zero, a one, and 14 additional elements that
we name $$\alpha^1$$ to $$\alpha^{14}$$. Here's the total set of field elements:

$$(0, 1, \alpha^1, \alpha^2, \alpha^3, \ldots, \alpha^{14})$$

We're using an exponent to number each $$\alpha$$ because that's how we're going to
construct their tuple values.

For the 0 and 1 field elements, we choose tuples $$(0,0,0,0)$$ and $$(0,0,0,1)$$.
$$\alpha^1$$ is called the primitive element. From the remaining 14 tuples, there are
multiple options that can serve a primitive element, but let's choose tuple $$(0,0,1,0)$$.
From here we can derive the tuple values for the remaining elements by using 
polynomial multiplication.


$$
\begin{align}
\alpha^1 = (0,0,1,0) = x \\
\alpha^2 = \alpha^1\alpha^1 = x\cdot x = x^2 =  (0,1,0,0) \\
\alpha^3 = \alpha^2\alpha^1 = x^2\cdot x = x^3 =  (1,0,0,0) \\
\end{align}
$$

So far so good. But now it gets interesting:

$$\alpha^4 = \alpha^3\alpha^1 = x^3\cdot x = x^4 = ???$$

$$x^4$$ is a polynomial with an order that it higher than what's allowed a $$\text{GF}(2^4)$$
field. We need to use the primitive polynomial to get the result back in check:

$$x^4 \bmod p(x) = x^4 \bmod (x^4+x+1) = x+1 $$

$$
\begin{align}
\alpha^4 = \alpha^3\alpha^1 = x^3\cdot x = x+1 =  (0,0,1,1) \\
\alpha^5 = \alpha^4\alpha^1 = (x+1)x = x^2+x =  (0,1,1,0) \\
\alpha^6 = \alpha^5\alpha^1 = (x^2+x)x = x^3+x^2 =  (1,1,0,0) \\
\alpha^7 = \alpha^6\alpha^1 = (x^3+x^2)x = x^4+x^3 = x^3+x+1 =  (1,0,1,1) \\
\end{align}
$$

For $$a^7$$, we could have done the polynomial division of $$x^4+x^3$$ with the primitive $$p(x)$$, 
but since we already calculated earlier that $$x^4$$ translates into $$x+1$$, it was easier to 
just do a substitution.

$$
\begin{align}
\alpha^8 = \alpha^7\alpha^1 = (x^3+x+1)x = x^4+x^2+x = x^2+x+x+1 = x^2+1 =  (0,1,0,1) \\
\alpha^9 = x^3+x = (1,0,1,0) \\
\alpha^{10} = x^2+x+1 = (0,1,1,1) \\
\alpha^{11} = x^3+x^2+x = (1,1,1,0) \\
\alpha^{12} = x^3+x^2+x+1 = (1,1,1,1) \\
\alpha^{13} = x^3+x^2+1 = (1,1,0,1) \\
\alpha^{14} = x^3+1 = (1,0,0,1) \\
\alpha^{15} = 1 = (0,0,0,1) \\
\alpha^{16} = x = (0,0,1,0) \\
\end{align}
$$

After $$\alpha^{14}$$, we restart at 1, or $$\alpha^0$$, and then $$\alpha^1$$, and so forth. The
whole sequence repeats again.

The take-away here is that there two main ways in which elements of a field can be described:

* a tuple that maps directly to a polynomial
* an element $$\alpha$$ with a certain exponent

The tuple and polynomial representation are great to do additions: you can just add,
or XOR in the case of a binary base field, each component. But the exponential
notation is great for multiplication: you can add the exponents and then do module 16
on the result. There's no need for a polynomial division.

# Mastrovito Multiplier

* irreducible  polynomial: $$p(x) = z^m + p_{m-1} \cdot z^{m-1} + \ldots + p_1 \cdot z + 1 $$.

  $$p(x)$$ is also called the field generator polynomial.

* basis: $$\vec{s} = [1,\alpha,\alpha^2,\ldots,\alpha^{m-1}]$$

* $$\alpha$$ is a root of $$p(z)$$, so: 

    $$\alpha^m = p_{m-1} \cdot \alpha^{m-1} + \ldots + p_1 \cdot \alpha + 1 $$

    XXX why is this?

* elements A and B

    $$A = a_0 + a_1 \alpha + \ldots + a_{m-1}\alpha^{m-1} \tag{1}$$

    $$B = b_0 + b_1 \alpha + \ldots + b_{m-1}\alpha^{m-1} \tag{1}$$

* With $$\vec{a} = [a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{m_1}]$$ and $$\vec{b} = [b_0, b_1, \ldots, b_{m_1}]$$,
  this can also be written as:

    $$A = \vec{s} \cdot \vec{a}^\intercal$$ 

    $$B = \vec{s} \cdot \vec{b}^\intercal$$

* C is the multiplication of A and B:

    $$C = b_0 \cdot A + b_1 \cdot A \cdot \alpha + \ldots + b_{m-1} \cdot A \cdot \alpha^{m-1} \tag{1}$$

    *Note how there's a scalar multiplication between $$b_i$$ and vector A.*

* This can also be written as:

    $$C = [ A, A \cdot \alpha, \ldots, A \cdot \alpha^{m-1} ] \cdot \vec{b}^\intercal$$

*  The following vectors are the standard-basis components of $$A\cdot\alpha^i$$:

    $$M_i = [ M_{0,i}, M_{1,i}, \ldots M_{m-1,i} ]$$

    and thus:

    $$ A\cdot\alpha^i = \vec{s} \cdot M_i^\intercal$$

    $$ C = \vec{s} \cdot [c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_{m-1}]^\intercal $$

    $$ C = \vec{s} \cdot [ M_0^\intercal, M_1^\intercal, \ldots, M_{m-1}^\intercal ] \cdot \vec{b}^\intercal $$

A Mastrovito multiplier have two steps:

1. Calculate matrix $$\mathbf{M}$$ using coefficient $$a_i$$ and coefficients $$p_i$$ from $$p(z)$$
2. Evaluate $$c_j = M_{j,0} \cdot b_0 + M_{j,1} \cdot b_1 + \ldots + M_{j,m_1} \cdot b_{m-1}$$

Step 2 does not require $$p(x)$$ and has a fixed number of XOR and AND gates, but step 1 is more
complex.

* Start with $$M_0$$:

    $$M_0 = [a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{m-1} ]$$

* $$M_i$$ can be generated from $$M_{i-1}$$ by multiplying with $$\alpha$$:

    $$\vec{s} \cdot M_i^\intercal = \alpha \cdot \vec{s} \cdot M_{i-1}^\intercal$$

    $$\alpha \cdot \vec{s} \cdot M_{i-1}^\intercal =  \alpha \cdot (M_{0,i-1} +  M_{1,i-1} \cdot \alpha + \ldots + M_{m-1,i-1} \cdot \alpha^{m-1})$$

    $$ =  M_{0,i-1} \cdot \alpha +  M_{1,i-1} \cdot \alpha^2 + \ldots + M_{m-1,i-1} \cdot \alpha^{m})$$

    $$\alpha^{m}$$ can be replaced by $$p_{m-1} \cdot \alpha^{m-1} + \ldots + p_1 \cdot \alpha + 1$$:

    $$ =  M_{0,i-1} \cdot \alpha +  M_{1,i-1} \cdot \alpha^2 + \ldots + M_{m-1,i-1} \cdot (p_{m-1} \cdot \alpha^{m-1} + \ldots + p_1 \cdot \alpha + 1)$$

    Regroup for $$\alpha^i$$:

    $$ =  M_{m-1,i-1} +  (M_{0,i-1} + p_1 \cdot M_{m-1,i-1})  \cdot \alpha + \ldots + (M_{m-2,i-1} + M_{m-1,i-1} \cdot p_{m-1}) \cdot \alpha^{m-1}$$

* Algorithm to calculate all values of $$M_i$$:

    $$M_0 = [a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{m-1} ]$$

    $$M_{0,i} = M_{m-1,i-1}$$

    $$M_{j,i} = M_{j-1,i-1} + M_{m-1,i-1} \cdot p_j$$


# Example

Example for $$\text{GF}(2^4)$$:

$$\vec{a} = [ a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3 ]$$

$$\vec{b} = [ a_0, b_1, b_2, b_3 ]$$

$$\vec{s} = [ 1, \alpha, \alpha^2, \alpha^3]$$

$$p(x) = 1 + x + x^4$$

$$\vec{p} = [p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4] = [1,1,0,0,1]$$

$$M_0 = [ a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3 ]$$

$$
M_1 = [  (a_3                ),
         (a_0 + a_3 \cdot p_1), 
         (a_1 + a_3 \cdot p_2), 
         (a_2 + a_3 \cdot p_3) 
         ]
$$

$$
M_2 = [ (a_2 + a_3 \cdot p_3), 
        (a_3                ) + (a_2 + a_3 \cdot p_3) \cdot p_1, 
        (a_0 + a_3 \cdot p_1) + (a_2 + a_3 \cdot p_3) \cdot p_2, 
        (a_1 + a_3 \cdot p_2) + (a_2 + a_3 \cdot p_3) \cdot p_3 
        ]
$$

$$
M_3 = [ ((a_1 + a_3 \cdot p_2) + (a_2 + a_3 \cdot p_3) \cdot p_3), 
        ((a_2 + a_3 \cdot p_3))                                   + ((a_1 + a_3 \cdot p_2) + (a_2 + a_3 \cdot p_3) \cdot p_3)) + a_3 \cdot p_1, 
        ((a_3                  + (a_2 + a_3 \cdot p_3) \cdot p_1) + ((a_1 + a_3 \cdot p_2) + (a_2 + a_3 \cdot p_3) \cdot p_3)) + a_3 \cdot p_2, 
        ((a_0 + a_3 \cdot p_1) + (a_2 + a_3 \cdot p_3) \cdot p_2) + ((a_1 + a_3 \cdot p_2) + (a_2 + a_3 \cdot p_3) \cdot p_3)) + a_3 \cdot p_3 
        ]
$$

# Linear Combination

It is possible to find an element $$\beta$$ from $$(0, 1, \alpha, \alpha^2, \ldots, \alpha^{14})$$ so that 
each element $$\alpha^i$$ can be written as:

$$\alpha^i = b_3\beta^8 + b_2\beta^3 +b_1\beta^2 +b_0\beta^1   $$

This is called a normal basis. The coefficients $$b_i$$ are elements
of the base field GF(2). XXXX does this only work for GF(2) ?
