Main power supply connector:

Should be       Actual
+10         ->  0           : comes from other board
+15         ->  +15
+9          ->  +12 
+5          ->  +7
GND         ->  GND
-9          ->  0
-15         ->  -15

Diagnosis for now:

* PCB requires BR81D bridge for BR501, but has been bodged with 4x 1N5288 Schottky diodes
    
    * 1 1N5288 fell off, probably there reasons why there is no -9V.
    * Service manual lists KBP201G as alternative. Available at Mouser.
    * 1N5288 has lower diode drop than diode bride. Does this increase the voltage
      at the output of the 5V?

* PCB has 10 Ohm/5 W bypass resistor across U501 voltage regulator.
* Voltage measured on 5V line is 7V, probably due to this resistor.
* Regulator is an LM340T-5 (also has 7805 marker on it.) TO220 package
* There are jumpers on the 5V source before it's used
* 9V (present as +12) goes to detection circuit, but -9V (not present) does not.

Plan:

* Check capacitors
* Buy 2x KBP201G 
* Buy LM340T-5 just to be sure
* Buy replacement resistor?
* Remove bodge 1N5288 diodes
* Cut 5V jumper, use external power supply. Also use external power supply for +/-9V?
