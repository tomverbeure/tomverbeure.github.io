# Introduction

In the past year, I've bought a bunch of measurement devices from a retired hobbyist who has
been downscaling his (extensive) RF lab. During my last visit, he offered to add some extras for free, including
a Racal-Dana 1992 Universal Counter.

![Racal-Dana 1992 Universal Counter](/assets/racal1992/racal1992.jpg)

A 1992 can be used as a frequency counter, to measure the delay between two signals, to calculate the
clock frequency ratio between 2 signals, and various other special functions, for frequencies all
the way up to 1.3GHz. And with up to 10 digits of precision, you get to measure the
frequency of your 10MHz crystal oscillator down to the milliHz (but only if your reference clock
is accurate enough...) When you start digging into the wonderful world of 
[Time Nuts](http://www.leapsecond.com/time-nuts.htm), the 1992 seems to be well respected. There's
a known issue with the flaky front panel switches, but there are plenty of Youtube video describing
how to fix it.

I didn't know it at the time, but its Buy-It-Now price on eBay is often higher than $500! *Thanks, John!*

My device came with option 55, a GPIB interface, and option 04E, a high stability oven controlled crystal 
oscillator ([OCXO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_oven)). John calibrated the instrument with his
GPS disciplined oscillator (GPSDO) as reference.

I've been looking at making a GPSDO myself, and thought it'd be interesting to use the 1992 to record
the phase difference between the raw, high jitter, GPS pulse-per-second (pps) signal that comes out of
my cheap M8N GPS receiver module, and the equivalent signal that's generated by the GPSDO. The first step 
to make that happen is establish communication between my PC and the 1992 using GPIB. It should be
relatively easy to do, but some well-placed booby-traps turned it into something that took
a whole day before everything was working as expected.

This short blog post describes the road blocks and how to get past them.

# GPIB: MATE/CIIL vs default protocol

The issue that took most of my time was getting the 1992 to talk the right protocol. Section
5 of the [User Manual](/assets/racal1992/RACAL-DANA-1991-1992-UserManual.pdf) is straightforward
enough: you send a string with one or more 2 or 3 characters and optional numerical
parameters, and the device will sometimes reply with a string that's always 21 bytes long.

The problem was that this didn't work *at all*. When I sent the internal self-test `CK` command,
I could see some LEDs temporarily flickering on the front panel and see the REM (remote) LED switch
permanently on, but every further GPIB transaction resulted in an error, and the device didn't
actually switch to `CK` mode either...

I eventually stumbled into [this conversation](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/testgear/racal-dana-1992-gpib-not-connecting/)
on the EEVblog forum, which mentions the existence of an SK4 jumper on the military version of the GPIB 
board that must be set in the right position. It also links to an 
[amended version of the manual](/assets/racal1992/racal1992_UserMan.pdf), with the following
diagram at page 200/7-22:

![SK4 diagram](/assets/racal1992/SK4_diagram.png)

Opening up the 1992 can be done by removing just 2 screws, after which you can slide out the bottom cover 
first, followed by the top:

![SK4 jumper in the chassis](/assets/racal1992/SK4_jumper_in_chassis.jpg)

Here's a closer look:

![SK4 jumper zoomed in](/assets/racal1992/SK4_jumper_zoomed_in.jpg)

This is how the jumper should be positioned if you want the GPIB interface to work as described
in the manual. In my case, the jumper was placed over the 2 pins right above it.

In that other position, the GPIB interface will conform to MATE/CIIL specification. Check out my
[updated blog post about test and measurement protocols](/2020/06/07/Making-Sense-of-Test-and-Measurement-Protocols.html#the-forgotten-mate-ciil-command-language)
to learn more about it. 

There are multiple versions of the GPIB interface board. From what I've been able to figure out, only version 
401820 has the SK4 jumper. It's part of option 02M which adds support for MATE/CIIL.

# Missing GPIB EOI at End of Message

With jumper SK4 in the right position, the 1992 immediately behaved as expected when sending configuration
commands: `CK` puts it into self-check mode, `PA` switches to period measurement on channel A, and
so forth.

Reading data back was still an issue.

I'm using [`pyvisa`](https://pyvisa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for my GPIB adventures.

Here's the code that you'd expect to work:

```python
import pyvisa

pyvisa.log_to_screen()
rm=pyvisa.ResourceManager()
inst = rm.open_resource("GPIB::14")
inst.write("RGS")
inst.read()
```

The `RGS` command is supposed to return the firmware version of the device, but the code
times out:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
2022-12-14 14:48:52,877 - pyvisa - DEBUG - GPIB0::14::INSTR - reading 20480 bytes (last status <StatusCode.success_max_count_read: 1073676294>)

    raise errors.VisaIOError(rv)

```

The solution came, once again, after finding 
[this EEVblog forum post](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/testgear/racal-dana-1992-gpib-not-connecting/msg821521/#msg821521):

[This comment on a National Instruments forum](https://forums.ni.com/t5/Instrument-Control-GPIB-Serial/Default-GPIB-termination-character/m-p/242651#M12923)
gives more details about EOI:

So here's what's happening:

* All messages from the Racal 1992 to the controller, your PC, are exactly 21 bytes.
* The messages end with 2 termination characters.
* **The GPIB EOI line is never asserted to indicate the end of a message!**

The `pyvisa` [`read()`](https://pyvisa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/resources.html#pyvisa.resources.MessageBasedResource.read)
and [`read_raw()`](https://pyvisa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/resources.html#pyvisa.resources.MessageBasedResource.read_raw)
commands keep on reading until they see `EOI`, even if you specify a size of 21 with `read_raw()`! 
The only way to correctly read the data is by using 
[`read_bytes()`](https://pyvisa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/resources.html#pyvisa.resources.MessageBasedResource.read_bytes). 

Like this:

```python
import pyvisa

rm=pyvisa.ResourceManager()
inst = rm.open_resource("GPIB::14")
inst.write("RGS")
inst.read_bytes(21)      <<<<<<<<<<
```

# When to Read Measurement Data

A final, minor, issue was knowing when the 1992 returns data.

Most instruments have a request-reply protocol, where the instrument only has data ready
to be read after the controller asks for it.

Not so for the 1992: it will indeed prepare data to be read after it has been sent
a command that starts with an `Rxx`, but it also places data in a read-data FIFO whenever
it completes a new measurement. Note also that there is no `Rxx` command to read back
measurement data, you just have to assume that there's going to be data available when
you issue a GPIB read. If not, then `pyvisa` will time out.

When you send an `R` command, the read-data FIFO gets cleared, you can be sure that
the first data after an `R` will be the data that you requested.

If you can't predict whether or not there'll be data available in the read-data FIFO,
e.g. because you're measuring events that don't happen at predictable points of time,
then you can program the 1992 with the `Q2`, `Q3`, `Q6` or `Q7` command to assert the 
GPIB SRQ (Service ReQuest) line when there's data available, and use the `pyvisa` 
[`wait_for_srq()`](https://pyvisa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/resources.html#pyvisa.resources.GPIBInstrument.wait_for_srq)
function.

![Racal 1992 SRQ Config Commands](/assets/racal1992/srq_config_commands.png)

Unfortunately, SRQ handling is not supported on a Linux machine with `pyvisa` and the
low-level `pyvisa-py` driver, so I wasn't able to test that.

A decent alternative is to manually poll the GPIB status byte which has 
the following status bits:

![Racal 1992 GPIB Status Bits](/assets/racal1992/gpib_status_bits.png)

*Note that the numbers starts with 1 instead of 0!*

In `pyvisa`, you can check this status byte with the [`stb`](https://pyvisa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/resources.html#pyvisa.resources.MessageBasedResource.stb) property.

Bit 4 (starting from 0) will be set when there's data waiting to be read.

Here's an example of an `stb` based polling loop:

```python
import pyvisa
rm = pyvisa.ResourceManager()
inst = rm.open_resource("GPIB::14")

while True:
    while (inst.stb & 0x10) == 0:
        print(".", end='', flush=True)
        pass
    print(inst.read_bytes(21))
```

And here's the result:

```
.............b'CK+0010.0000000E+06\r\n'
.............b'CK+0010.0000000E+06\r\n'
.............b'CK+0010.0000000E+06\r\n'
.............b'CK+0010.0000000E+06\r\n'
.............b'CK+0010.0000000E+06\r\n'
.............b'CK+0010.0000000E+06\r\n'
.............b'CK+0010.0000000E+06\r\n'
```


The other alternative is to program is very large timeout:

```python
inst.timeout=10000
```

# Weird Modal Syntax Error Behavior with 3-character Commands

On my system, all the example code above worked fine... until it didn't. I don't know what happened, but
from one moment to next, all commands with 3 characters resulted in a syntax error, as indicated
by the `stb` property:

```python
import pyvisa
rm = pyvisa.ResourceManager()
inst = rm.open_resource("GPIB::14")
inst.write("RGS")
print("STB: 0x%02x" % inst.stb)
```

```
STB: 0x25
```

The 3 LSBs of STB contain the error code, and a value of 5 means "Syntax error in GPIB
command".

My 1992 was not able to recover from it. (It still hasn't!) Sending the instrument preset 
`IP` command, power cycling the unit, rebooting the PC, unplugging the GPIB dongle, none of that
has worked.

I found 3 ways to work around it:

* Add a space in front of each command

    Instead of this:

    ```python
inst.write("RGS")
    ```
    
    Do this:

    ```python
inst.write(" RGS")
    ```

* Change the GPIB write terminator from `\r\n` to `\n\r`

    I have no idea why this makes a difference, but it does.

    This is magical `pyvisa` incantation:

    ```python
inst.write_termination='\n\r'
    ```

    This has the benefit over adding a space that you only need to do this once,
    but it has the potential disadvantage that it may not work on an instrument
    that doesn't have my issue.

    You can select the correct terminator by checking for syntax errors. Like this:

    ```python
inst.write_termination='\r\n'
inst.write("RUT")
if (inst.stb & 0x7) == 5:
    inst.write_termination='\n\r'
    inst.write("RUT")
if (inst.stb & 0x7) == 5:
    raise Exception("Can't find working write termination!")
else:
    # Read data from dummy RUT command
    unit_type = inst.read_bytes(21)
    ```

* Don't assert `EOI` for write operations

    When using `ibtest`, which is part of the Linux GPIB tools, I'm also able to make it work 
    by instructing it to not send an `EOI` at the end of a transmission (`o` followed by 0).

    However, `pyvisa` doesn't give you the option to not send `EOI`.

I've been working a Racal-Dana 1992 driver for [`pymeasure`](https://github.com/pymeasure/pymeasure).
Since I'm the one who's writing it, I can use the first option without the need to
fiddle with termination options. 

It's unsettling when something that used work perfectly fine suddenly doesn't,
with no known way to restore things. If anyone has an idea, I'd love to hear about it!
