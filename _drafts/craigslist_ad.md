This synthesized signal generator was built by the Fluke Corporation, famous for building high quality voltmeters, and related instruments. Apparently, they were trying to broaden their product base to better compete with HP. The Fluke 6070A was targeted at the low noise RF test market, then dominated by the HP8640. The 6070A used a clever technique to produce low phase noise signals, lowering overall cost to better compete with the HP8640. The Fluke 6070A also includes both AM and FM modulation as well as a digital sweep function. Instead of creating the sweep using a voltage ramp driving a voltage tuned source it synthesizes each frequency step in the sweep.

Fluke also made significant improvements in signal generator usability. For example, the "spin wheel" works like it should, unlike the knob on the HP8662. The Fluke 6070A is also smaller than the HP generators: the front panel is only 5 1/4 inches tall, rather than 7 inches. Weight is also somewhat less.

The instrument seems to have been built in the early '80's. It has GPIB and, apparently, reverse power protection (a box on the rear panel is checked). It does not have an internal OCXO, but does have an external 10MHz "reference input". Internal circuits phase-lock the internal oscillator to the external 10MHz reference, significantly improving accuracy and stability. The standard crystal oscillator has OK specs, good enough for non-critical operation. For example, that oscillator is specified as stable to +-5 ppm over a temperature range of 32 deg. F to 122 deg. F. At 500MHz, 5 ppm is 2.5KHz.

Note: an external 10MHz reference is used for all photos.

Some specs (from data sheet - not verified):
Frequency range: 200KHz to 520MHz (it will tune to 525.0MHz but for the last 5MHz the "Uncal" annunciator is lit)
Frequency tuning step: 1Hz
Amplitude range: +19dBm to -140dBm
Frequency accuracy vs temp. (using internal crystal oscillator): +-5 ppm over the range of 32 deg. F to 122 deg. F
Phase noise: typically -120dBc to -140dBc @20KHz offset. Increases closer to carrier.

Weight: 61 lbs.

Features: AM/FM Modulation, digital frequency sweep, setup save/recall, GPIB, user guide on pull out tab, etc.

I have owned this instrument since the 1990's and have had no problems with it. In the past 10+ years it has gotten little use. All features and functions I recently tested seem to work well. The GPIB was not tested since I don't have the required controller. I also do not have phase noise measurement capability, other than a spectrum analyzer.

Physical Condition: front and rear panels appear near new. The trim pieces that run down each side and parts of the side panels are scuffed from moving the instrument on a rough surface.
