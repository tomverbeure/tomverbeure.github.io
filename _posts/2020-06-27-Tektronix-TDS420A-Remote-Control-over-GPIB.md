# Introduction

In [my earlier post](/2020/06/27/In-the-Lab-Tektronix-TDS420A.html), I introduced my 'new'
Tektronix TDS 420A oscilloscope, which I bought to add Tektronix support to 
[glscopeclient](https://hackaday.com/2019/05/30/glscopeclient-a-permissively-licensed-remote-oscilloscope-utility/).

The first step in that process is to get my PC to talk to the scope through the GPIB interface.

It's not a complicated process, and there's quite a bit of information online that describes how
to do this, but in this post I go through the gory details how to get from nothing to fetching recorded
waveforms from the scope onto your PC.

From unpacking the scope, it only took about 30 minutes and 95% of that time was *obviously* spent 
getting Linux drivers right.

# Acquiring a USB to GPIB Dongle

[GPIB](/2020/06/07/Making-Sense-of-Test-and-Measurement-Protocols.html#gpib--ieee-488)
is an obsolete interface standard. Modern test and measurement equipment comes with
an Ethernet and/or a USB port. But not too long ago, virtually all equipment had GPIB support,
and thus most of the older equipment you'll buy second hand on eBay will come with one too.

The sturdy, specialized GPIB connector itself was already quite expensive
back in the day, so a full GPIB interface card or dongle was never cheap.

You can find [UGPlus](http://www.lqelectronics.com/Products/USBUG/UGPlus/UGPlus.html) USB to
GPIB controllers for around $40 on Amazon, but they aren't supported on Linux.

The cheapest Linux supported option that I could find was an 
[Agilent/Keysight 82357B](https://www.keysight.com/en/pd-851808-pn-82357B/usb-gpib-interface-high-speed-usb-20).
They're listed for $624 on the Keysight website, but you should be able to find one for ~$70 on eBay
or AliExpress.

Not wanting to wait for weeks for a shipment from China, I bought a 
[National Instruments GPIB-USB-HS](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/model.gpib-usb-hs.html) instead. 
Instead of the $1059 list price, I got mine for $100 on eBay.

# Installing the GPIB-USB-HS Linux Kernel Driver

It's hard to believe, but despite supporting pretty much any kind of device imaginable, the 
main line Linux kernel doesn't have any support for GPIB interfaces.

Luckily, there is the [Linux GPIB Package](https://linux-gpib.sourceforge.io/) which contains driver modules for
a variety of such interfaces, as well as whole bunch of user mode libraries and test programs.

**One major downside of the method described below is that you need to recompile and reinstall the driver 
whenever there's even a minor update of the Linux kernel. It's not a lot of work, just a very annoying
distraction.**

Here's the recipe that worked for my Ubuntu 18.04 distribution:

* Install Linux Kernel Headers

    ```
sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
    ```

    `uname -r` returns the directory name for the Linux kernel that you're running.
    In my case, it's `5.3.0-53-generic`.

    You will need to redo this step whenever you (or the automated updating system of your
    distribution!) upgrade your kernel to a later version. It's really annoying...

* Download the latest version of the Linux-GPIB package

    ```
cd ~/projects
svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/linux-gpib/code/trunk linux-gpib-code
cd linux-gpib-code/linux-gpib-kernel
    ```

    Yes: `svn`. Some projects still use it. I had to install Subversion on my machine just for this.

* Compile and install

    ```
make
sudo make install
    ```

    This will install the gpib drivers in `/lib/module/<kernel version>/gpib`:

    ```
cd /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/gpib
find .
    ```
    ```
.

    ```

* Install the appropriate GPIB driver into the kernel

    For the GPIB-USB-HS, that's the `ni_usb_gpib` driver:

    ```
sudo modprobe ni_usb_gpib
    ```

* Check that the driver gets loaded

    Plug in your GPIB USB dongle, and check what happens with `dmesg`:

    ```
dmesg -w
[63517.842042] usb 1-11.4: new high-speed USB device number 17 using xhci_hcd

[63517.977620] usbcore: registered new interface driver ni_usb_gpib
[63517.977621] gpib: registered ni_usb_b interface
    ```

    Success!

But wait, there's more! We still need to install GPIB user mode libraries and utilities.

# Installing the GPIB User Mode Library and Utilities

The National Instrument GPIB USB dongles have small microcontroller on them that needs its
own firmware. This firmware must be loaded into the dongle before the dongle is able to behave
as a GPIB interface. The firmware, and the utility to load it into the dongle, is part of the
same Linux GPIB package that also contained the kernel above.


I used the following recipe:

* Compile and install the whole thing:

    ```
    cd linux-gpib-user
    ./bootstrap/
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig
    ```

    This will install an important configuration file in `/usr/local/etc/gpib.conf`.

    (If you want the location of this file to be under `/etc` instead, you can do so with
    by using `./configure --sysconfdir=/etc` instead of just `./configure`.)

* Update the `/usr/local/etc/gpib.conf` configuration file

    In my case, all I had to do was change `board_type = "ni_pci"` to `board_type = "ni_usb_b"`.

* Load firmware into the dongle

    `sudo gpib_config`

    When you run `dmesg` now, there will be some warnings unexpected data in some buffer, but
    that didn't seem to have any adverse impact on the functionality:

    ```

# Set the GPIB Device Address on the TDS 420A

The GPIB protocol supports up to 31 devices on a single daisy chained cable. But there's no plug
and play here, the address of each device needs to be assigned manually.

![Change GPIB Address](/assets/tds420a/change_gpib_address.png)

On the TDS 420A, you do this as follows. (See also the
[user manual](https://www.tek.com/oscilloscope/tds420a-manual/tds410a-tds420a-tds460a-user-manual) on page 3-91.)

* Press SHIFT UTILITY -> System (main) -> I/O (pop-up) -> Port (main) -> GPIB (pop-up) -> Configure (main) -> Talk/Listen Address

I selected address 1.

# First Contact!

We can now finally test the whole connection.

The Linux GPIB package comes with a number of utilities, one of which is `ibtest`. Let's give it a try:

* `sudo ibtest`

    `udev` permission haven't been set yet, so, for now, let's run it as root.

* `d` (for 'device)

    `ibtest` can be used to talk to a GPIB connected device (like our scope) or to the GPIB interface dongle itself.

* `1` for GPIB address

    This is obviously the address that was assigned earlier into the scope.

* `w` : write string to scope

* `*IDN?`

    This is the standard SCPI command that returns an identification string.

* `r` : read the reply from the scope
* `1024`
* Result:

    ```
: r
enter maximum number of bytes to read [1024]: 1024
trying to read 1024 bytes from device...
received string: 'TEKTRONIX,TDS 420A,0,CF:91.1CT FV:v1.0.2e
'
Number of bytes read: 42
gpib status is:
ibsta = 0x2100  < END CMPL >
iberr= 0
    ```

    We have successfully received the identification info from the scope: manufacturer,
    product name, revision number and firmware version.

# Setting Up UDEV rules

`udev` rule set user permissions and can do all kinds of funky stuff behind the scenes.

It took me ages to get things working, and reloading the rules with `sudo udevadm control --reload` was not
sufficient: *a reboot was necessary*!

Create a file called `/etc/udev/rules.d/72-linux_gpib_ni_usb.rules`:

```
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ACTION=="add", ATTRS{idVendor}=="3923", ATTRS{idProduct}=="709b", MODE="666", GROUP="tom", SYMLINK+="usb_gpib"
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ACTION=="add", ATTRS{idVendor}=="3923", ATTRS{idProduct}=="709b", RUN+="/usr/local/sbin/gpib_config"
KERNEL=="gpib[0-9]*", MODE="666", GROUP="tom"
```

You will need to change `GROUP="tom"` to something else.

Earlier, we called `sudo gpib_config` to load the GPIB-USB-HS firmware into the device. The second in the udev
parameters above now does that automatically as soon as you plug in the GPIB dongle in the USB port.

Reboot your machine, unplug the USB cable of the dongle and plug it back in, and try out `ibtest`, but this
time without prefixing it with `sudo`.

Does it work? Congratulations! You're ready to start fetching waveforms from the scope!

# Fetching a Waveform - The Bare Minimum

We'll be using `pyvisa`, the Pyton API for instrumentation that I introduced in
[a previous blog post](/2020/06/07/Making-Sense-of-Test-and-Measurement-Protocols.html#visa---one-api-that-rules-them-all).

Fetch waveforms is just a matter of sending the right command query to the scope. Check out of 
[TDS Family Programmers Manual](https://www.tek.com/manual/tds-family-programmer-manual) for a comprehensive list
of all the commands and how to use them.

It can be as simple as this:

```python
#! /usr/bin/env python3
import pyvisa

# Open a link to device 1 of the GPIB bus
rm = pyvisa.ResourceManager()
g = rm.open_resource('GPIB0::1::INSTR')

# Get the sample points
wf = g.query("CURV?")
print(wf)
```

The output of this program could be something like this:
```
:CURV 78,79,78,77,79,79,79,79,78,83,79,81,78,78,79,77,81,77,78,80,78,79,
78,77,-46,-49,-46,-45,-46,-45,-44,-45,-47,-46,-47,-45,-44,-45,-44,-44,-44,
-44,-47,-44,-45,-46,-45,-44,-41,81,80,80,80,80,81,81,80,80,79,79,79,77,
80,79,78,76,77,79,79,80,79,80,79,78,-48,-44,-45,-48,-50,-47,-56,-46,-45,
-46,-46,-45,-44,-45,-44,-46,-43,-46,-46,-44,-45,-44,-45,-47,-47,81,80,79,
80,79,79,80,81,78,78,77,79,80,84,77,78,77,77,79,79,80,77,78,79,79,-46,-49,
...
```

A discerning reader will see a square wave in the data above!

# Fetching and Plotting a Waveform

The problem with the example above is that a Tektronix scope has many different
settings that will influence how the data is returned.

For example, the returned waveform data starts with `:CURV`,
a redundant repeat of the query command. The waveform values are returned in
ASCII text format, as a command separate list etc. Your scope might
have been configured to return waveform data as signed 8-bit integers, or
maybe even signed 16-bit numbers.

Your code will be very brittle if you rely on these kinds of settings, so it's
better to tell the scope exactly how you want the data to be returned.

Let's look at an extended example. 
(Complete source code [here](/assets/tds420a/visa_get_tek_waveform.py).)

The start is the same:

```python
#! /usr/bin/env python3
import pyvisa

import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

rm = pyvisa.ResourceManager()
g = rm.open_resource('GPIB0::1::INSTR')
```

Specify the way the data will be returned:
```python
# Don't repeat the command in the reply. This is easier to parse the result.
g.write("HEAD OFF")

# Encode the waveform as a comma-separated list
g.write("DATA:ENC ASCI")
```

Let the scope record the data:
```python
# Record 500 waveform samples
g.write("HOR:RECORDL 500");

# Setup a single sequence acquisition
g.write("ACQ:STOPA SEQ")

# Don't do repetitive acquisition (~equivalent-time operation)
g.write("ACQ:REPE OFF")

# Start acquiring data
g.write("ACQ:STATE RUN")
```

Fetch the waveform parameters and the waveform data from the scope:
```python
# Request data from channel 1 only
g.write("DATA:SOURCE CH1")

# Get all waveform acquisition settings needed decode the sample point 
# values: vdiv, number of sample points etc.
wf_params = g.query("WFMPRE?")
print(wf_params)

# Get the sample points
wf = g.query("CURV?")
print(wf)
```

Plot the waveform on the screen:
```python
# Convert comma separate string of signed integer values to list of integers
values = list(map(int, wf.split(",")))

# Plot
x = range(0, len(values))
plt.plot(x, values)
plt.show()
```

If everything went well, something like this should appear on your screen:

![Waveform](/assets/tds420a/waveform.png)

This example still leaves a lot to be desired: it simply graphs integer numbers instead
of converting sample values to voltages, the X-axis unit is sample number instead of time.

The `WFMPRE?` command gives you all the information to do this right, but that's
left as an exercise for the reader.

The main goal has been achieved: we can fetch data from the scope to the PC and
do something useful with it!

# The GPL3 License of the Linux-GPIB Package

It's important to point out that the user mode libraries the Linux GPIB driver 
are licensed under the GPL 3.0. The consequence is that projects with a less restrictive
open source license can't just be built with the Linux GPIB library without applying the GPL 3.0 license
to the whole project.

There is a good discussion about this [here](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/1640/if-im-using-a-gpl-3-library-in-my-project-can-i-license-my-project-under-mit-l)
on Stackoverflow.

For my purposes, this isn't a huge deal: instead of writing a C++ GPIB backend for 
scopehal/glscopeclient, I will write a TCP/IP to GPIB server instead. `glscopeclient` already 
has a TCP/IP socket based transport driver, so by using such a server, no additional transport driver 
would need to be written.
