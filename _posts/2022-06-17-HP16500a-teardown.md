# Introduction

I recently became the proud owner of an HP 16500A logic analyzer for the low low price of $20.

![Logic Analyzer on Cart](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/1_logic_analyzer_on_cart.jpg)

Or better, I'm now the owner of **two** HP 16500A logic analyzers, because the seller had a
whole pallet of them, and when you have a spare, you can afford to take more risks while
experimenting with them. The second one even came with an HP keyboard and mouse.

$20 is obviously an exception, but these machines aren't expensive in general: you should be able
to find one for $100 on eBay without much effort, though expect to add another $75 for shipping,
because these things are big and heavy.

![Logic Analyzer on Cart with Cables and Keyboard](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/1b_logic_analyzer_on_cart.jpg)

The 16500A is a mainframe design, with a 6-slot backplane that contains CPU controller board
and 5 additional slots for various plug-in measurement cards. My 2 units 
came with an HP 16510A: an 80 channel 25MHz/100MHz digital acquisition card with a 4K 
acquisition depth, but higher performance cards exist. 

The logic analyzer functionality itself is not particularly useful for me: 
I never need to record that many channels in parallel, the acquisition depth is pathetic, 
the maximum sample rate is too low, and it's not trivial to get data of the machine for later analysis, 
because you need either use a non-standard floppy drive or the GPIB interface. It's also a huge, heavy 
beast that's impractical to move around on a bench, and you can't even disconnect the unwieldy
measurement cables that you don't use.

In short, this unit is worse in almost any respect than the [Saleae Logic Pro 16](https://www.saleae.com) 
that I use at work. It also explains the low cost: there are much better alternatives. Its
successor, the 16500B, uses a much faster hard disk to store the main software, and the 16500C
has support for an Ethernet connection.

But it's always fun to take a vintage piece of electronics apart just for the sake
of it, learn about its special features, and maybe come up with some interesting
future project ideas?

So in this blog post, I'll take whole thing apart and try to figure out how what makes
it tick.

# Safety First

Before opening and working on this machine, it's import talk about safety: 

**WORKING ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD KILL YOU.** 

There, I’ve said it. So, please, if you're not familiar with devices like this,
just read this blog for entertainment and don't try to reproduce my results.
If you decide to do it anyway, you do so at your risk, and take a number of 
basic precautions:

* **Read the [HP 16500A service manual][HP 16500A Service Manual].** 
  It is authoritative, unlike the scrappy blog of some electronics hobbyist.
* **Unplug the AC power cable** before you start going at it with a screw driver.
* **Wait 5 minutes after unplugging the AC power cable**: the power supply unit of an HP 16500A 
  has a lot of large capacitors and does not have bleeder resistors to quickly discharge 
  them after power is removed.
* **The power switch on the front panel is not in fact a power switch.** It merely puts the device in a
  standby low(er) power state. There is a real power switch at the back of the device.
* **The HP 16500A power supply unit creates 120V DC to power the CRT module**. Most power supply 
  units only create relatively low DC voltages, this one does not. Be extra careful.
* **CRT tubes require very high voltages**. I’m not totally sure about this one, but the CRT 
  schematic has annotations of 800V. 
* **Be extra careful about dropping screws.** There are a lot of them. If one drops, get it 
  out before moving on to the next one. You don't want specialty fireworks due to a screw
  induced short circuit!
* If you want to switch on the device while the covers are removed, **tape some 
  cardboard on top of the CRT unit** to prevent accidentally touching the high voltage parts.
* **Never do any measurements inside the bowels of the CRT module** when it’s powered on. 
  Sony provided a lot of measurement test points on the outside PCBs. There is absolutely 
  no need to get inside.
* **Have a clean workspace.** My bench is usually a horrible mess, but I unclutter it for 
  projects like this.

# Powering it up

*Taking pictures of running CRT screen is a pain, and they generally look terrible. Just assume that
whatever you see here will look much better in real life.*

After powering up the device, you should see a boot screen like this:

![Boot Screen](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/2_bootup_screen.jpg)

The HP 16500A has 2 floppy drives, one in the front and one in the back, and other than some 
boot EPROMs, it has no other means to store its system software. So in practice you'll always
keep a system disk in the rear floppy drive. The floppy drive is not compatible with standard
drives from the mid eighties: it's a special 600RPM Sony drive.

# Disassembly Tools

I've opened 
[plenty](/2021/04/15/Agilent-E3631A-Knob-Repair.html) of 
[test](/2020/06/27/In-the-Lab-Tektronix-TDS420A.html) and 
[measurement](/2021/11/26/HP3478A-Multimeter-Repair-with-a-Hacksaw.html)
devices before, and so far, all I needed where regular
flat-head, Philips, and hexagonal screw drivers. Not so for the HP16500A: it uses Torx 10, 15,
and 20 screws everywhere. And even if you already have some Torx heads that plug into a 
generic screwdriver, you still won't be able to open up the logic analyzer.

That's because you can't remove any of the 4 enclosing side panels without removing 4 feet
at the back and each of those 4 feet has a Torx 10 screw sunken deep inside a narrow hole. 

![4 feet at the back of the logic analyzer](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/3_back_with_4_feet.jpg)

The only way to get to it was with a dedicated, narrow, Torx screw driver, not a generic
one with exchangable heads.

![Trox 10 screwdriver sunk into a feet](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/4_sunken_screwdriver.jpg)

One of the benefits of having many projects going on in parallel is that you can switch
to something else while an order for tools is on its way. 

![Set of Torx screwdrivers](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/5_set_of_torx_screwdrivers.jpg)

*If you're going the route of buying a set, do yourself a favor and buy **security** Torx 
screwdrivers: they fit in the same holes are regular ones, but have an additional axial hole for security
Torx screws, which will allow you, hypothetically, to remove somebody's Ring camera from their
front door.*

# Tearing Down the Logic Analyzer

*If you're not interested in knowing exactly which screws to unscrew or connector to unplug, click
[here](#identifying-components-inside-hp-products) to fast-forward to the next section.*

Section VI of the service manual explains how to take the whole device apart to replace pretty 
much all larger components in case of failure. It's not particularly difficult to open it up,
but I have a bit of tradition of showing too much of the disassembly process than too little, 
and I'm not going to stop that here.

**Remove plug-in cards and empty slot covers**

Let's start with that, because it's easy and all these annoying cables won't be in the way anymore.

Note that it's not possible to remove the CPU system card at the bottom, because not only does
the left bottom foot blocks it from sliding out, but also because a few flat cables,
accessible after removal of the bottom panel, must be unplugged first.

![Remove plug-in cards](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/6_remove_plug_in_cards.jpg)

Here is the removed HP 16510A acquistion card:

![HP 16510A acquisition card](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/7_16510a_acquisition_card.jpg)

These 5 heatsinks probably cover some custom ASICs, and are thus a bit of dead-end. I'll
leave them be. 

**Remove the 4 feet in the back**

![4 feet at the back of the logic analyzer](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/3_back_with_4_feet.jpg)

Yes, this is the same picture as above!

**Remove 3 back panel retention screws**

There isn't a 4th screw, because one side panels has a carrying handle and screws to keep in place.

![3 back panel retention screws](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/8_back_panel_screws.jpg)

Whenever possible, I tape the screws to the place where they came from. That makes it 
much easier to assemble thing back together later. 

![screw taped to the top panel next to the screw hole](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/9_tape_screws_where_they_belong.jpg)

**Remove the handle from the side panel**

![side panel with handle](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/10_side_panel_with_handle.jpg)

A friend gave me rolling equipment cart. These things are amazing when you need to remove screws 
from all sides of a 40 pounds heavy box.

**Remove the top and side panels**

We can now remove the panels. You can slide each of the 4 panels from the front to the back,
but there can be quite a bit of friction. The easiest way is to remove the top panel first. 

Insert a flathead screwdriver in the gap between the back of the top panel and the back of the power
supply unit and rotate the screwdriver until the panel comes loose.

![Use screwdriver to loosen top panel](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/11_use_screwdriver_to_loosen_top_panel.jpg)

Once loose, you can now easily slide out the top panel.

![Sliding out the top panel](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/12_slide_out_top_panel.jpg)

Since we already removed their back screws, the side panels can now slide out too. 

You'll be greeted by the following sight:

![Top of the logic analyzer exposed](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/13_top_of_logic_analyzer_exposed.jpg)

We can see a huge power supply, the front and back floppy drives, and the CRT unit.

All of these will come out soon.

**Remove the bottom panel**

Let's turn the unit on its side and slide out the bottom panel.

![Bottom of the logic analyzer exposed](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/14_bottom_of_logic_analyzer_exposed.jpg)

We now have access to all the main components.

**Remove the CPU controller board**

The video cable and the floppy drive cable are the only ones that connect directly to the CPU controller 
board. They're much easier to unplug now that the back panel has been removed. I also unplugged the 
frontpanel cable and the orange cooling fan control cable, but that's not necessary to remove the CPU board.

![Unplug CPU board cables](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/15_unplug_cpu_board_cables.jpg)

After removing the 2 screws in the back that secure the CPU board, we can slide it out. It looks really nice. 
Let's put it aside for now. We'll check it out more in detail later.

![CPU board removed](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/16_cpu_board_removed.jpg)

The whole chassis starting to look pretty empty already, but we're far from being
done!

![Looks from the side](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/17_look_from_the_side.jpg)

**Remove the front floppy drive**

The front floppy drive blocks the exit of the power supply board. We can take it out
by removing the 2 screws that are on the retaining bracket. (The second screw is
hidden underneath the flat cable.)

![Front floppy drive screws](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/18_floppy_drive_bracket.jpg)

**Remove the power supply unit**

Getting the power supply unit out of the chassis is a bit more complicated. 

There's a backplate screwed to the power supply with 3 screws:

![Power supply back screws](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/19_power_supply_back_screws.jpg)

On top, there are 2 screws that fix the power supply to the back frame, and 
2 screws that are hidden below the black safety cover.

It's not strictly necessary, but I also removed the 4 screws at the top to
take off the safety cover itself, so that I could have a better look at the 
components of the power supply itself.

**There is supposed to be Kapton tape over the 4 screws that hold the cover in
place. Make sure to put that tape back when you reassemble the logic analyzer,
because there's a live voltage on those screws and they could make contact with
the metal enclosure!!!**

![Power supply top screws](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/20_power_supply_top_screws.jpg)

Now is also a good time to disconnect the CRT cable. It carries the 120V power for the
CRT as well as the degauss signal that goes to a switch that's located on the back of the
power supply.

At first, the power supply cable seems surprisingly flimsy to carry the power of a CRT.
But keep in mind that the thickness of a power cable is primarily determined by the current
that must go through it, not the power. With a peak power of 60W, the supply voltage of 120V
results in maximum current of only 0.5A. You don't need a thick cable for that.

![CRT power connector](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/21_crt_power_connector.jpg)

You can now disconnect the whole power supply from the backplane PCB by sliding it
back by about a centimeter.

![Slide back power supply](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/22_slide_back_power_supply.jpg)

The power supply is held in place by teeth of a back plate the slide into plastic retaining
slits. Once you moved the power supply back in the previous step, you should be able to
lift the power supply out of the chassis. It's a little bit tricky.

It's a beast of a power supply that's mounted on a heavy metal backplate.

![Remove back power supply](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/23_remove_power_supply.jpg)

**Front panel removal**

The front panel contains a cool optical touch screen sensor. I definitely want to take
a look at that, so off it goes.

At the top of the front panel, there's a gray strip that covers 7 screws. The strip can
easily be removed with a narrow flat-head screwdriver. There are also 7 screws at the bottom.

![Front panel top row cover and screws](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/24_front_panel_top_row_screws.jpg)

After removing all 14 screws, the front panel is loose, but it will still be connected to the
chassis with an interface controls flatcable to goes to the backplane PCB, and with a
contrast and brightness cable that goes to the CRT. Unplug them too.

![Front panel cables](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/25_front_panel_cables.jpg)

The front panel has metal shielding around it. You can simply remove it.

![Disconnected front panel with metal shielding](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/26_front_panel_with_metal_shielding.jpg)

We can now have a good look at the internals of the user controls: rotary encoder, 2 potentiometers for
brightness and contrast control, and, of course, rows and columns of LEDs and photodiodes for
the optical touch screen. I love it!

I plan to do a deeper dive on this in a future blog post.

![Disconnected front panel without shielding](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/27_front_panel_without_shielding.jpg)

**CRT Removal**

The final big item to remove is the CRT unit. It's a Sony CHM-9001-00 with a Trinitron tube.
This is probably the most interesting part of the whole logic analyzer. I've been experimenting
with it and there'll be definitely more to come on this one.

![Sony sticker on the CRT](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/28_CRT_sticker.jpg)

Remove the 4 screws that fix the CRT to the front top and bottom rails of the chassis:

The CRT claims a 9" active area, which seems about right.

![CRT front screws](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/29_CRT_front.jpg)

2 screws in the back fix the CRT unit to the side of the chassis.

![CRT side screws](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/30_CRT_side_screws.jpg)

The CRT unit can now slide out through the front. There were some black
metal clips and grey plastic that was a little bit in the way, but after pushing
those aside, it came right out.

**Backplane removal**

I wanted to check out the backside of the backplane, so I removed it too. It has 6
screws.


![Backplane with 6 screws](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/30a_backplane.jpg)

**All removed pieces together!**

Here are all the items that have been removed, neatly organized next to each other.

![All removed pieces next to eachother](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/31_all_removed_pieces.jpg)

All that's left in the chassis are the back floppy drive and 2 fans. It's a whole lot
lighter now!

# Identifying Components inside HP Products

After taking everything apart, I wanted to identify some of the internal electrical components.

One useful piece of knowledge for those who want to do the same kind of exercise: there are at least
3 different types of HP part number identification:

* the generic part name of the original manufacturer. E.g. SN74LS374N is a piece of glue logic
  from the standard 74LS family.
* the HP part number. Many components, even generic ones, were custom marked for HP with their
  unique number. And the generic name is sometimes dropped altogether. Here's an example on the controller
  board having 2 ICs with only HP part number 1820-1438:

  ![HP part number 1820-1438](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/34_hp_part_number.jpg)

  How do you map that to a generic name? By looking up the number in an 
 [HP Bench Brief](/assets/hp16500a/datasheets/HP-Bench-Briefs-1990-07-12.pdf). Bench briefs
  were a magazine with service information about HP products. In addition to some information
  about the inner workings of HP equipment, trouble shooting tips, it also contains lists with HP 
  part numbers and their generic name. Like this:

  ![HP Bench Brief entry for 1820-1438](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/35_bench_brief_table.jpg)

  A 1820-1438 corresponds to an SN74LS257, a 4x MUX with tri-state.

  You can find the [HP Bench Briefs](http://hparchive.com/bench_briefs) at the Hewlett Packard Archive.

* the National Stock Number or NSN. These are number assigned by the department of defense
  for inventory handling of replacement parts. You won't find these numbers on the ICs themselves,
  but when you're googling unknown components, you'll very often run into these.

# Main Controller Board Overview

The service manual has a good block diagram of the main controller board: 

[![Motherboard block diagram](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/33_motherboard_block_diagram.png)](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/33_motherboard_block_diagram.png)
*(Click for full size version)*

The system is conventional but I still wanted to get a better idea about what 
exactly made the logic analyzer tick. So I started annotating a few components...  and didn't 
know where to stop. 

The result is the PCB board with *all* components identified:

[![CPU board annotated](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/32_cpu_board_front_annotated.jpg)](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/32_cpu_board_front_annotated.jpg)
*(Click for full size version)*

The only major unknown is IC 1FI1-0002 at the bottom. Based on its location and, by elimination, on the block diagram,
it's almost certainly a part of the "Module Interface / Intermodule Bus Monitor".

# CPU System Components

The core of the system consists of the CPU, RAM, and ROM:

* a good old Motorola 68000 as main CPU

    The P10 version is rated at 10 MHz. ([User’s Manual](/assets/hp16500a/datasheets/MC68000FN10_to_MC68HC001RC8.pdf))

* a whopping 1 MByte of DRAM

    Built out of 8 256K x 4 bit Toshiba [TC514256P-10](/assets/hp16500a/datasheets/TC514256P-85-Toshiba.pdf) ICs.

    The -10 version has a row access cycle time of 100ns and the fast page mode cycle time of 55ns, though given
    the 10MHz clock of the CPU, I doubt that it will do accesses faster than 100ns.

* 32K x 16 bits EPROM 

    Built with 2 32K x 8 bits [D27C256](/assets/hp16500a/datasheets/D27C256.pdf), it contains the initial
    boot code. 

    They are the type of EPROM that can be erased by shining a strong UV light through a glass window
    for 15 to 20 minutes.

    I bought a TL866-II EPROM reader on AliExpress to dump the contents of the EPROMs for
    analysis and reverse engineering in Ghidra. The reader worked great, but soon after doing that somebody
    [pointed out](https://twitter.com/bitsavers/status/1490759359487299585)
    that [bitsavers.org](http://www.bitsavers.org) already had an 
    [archive with the binary images](http://bitsavers.org/bits/HP/16500/16500A/). They also have
    the [service and system reference manuals](http://www.bitsavers.org/test_equipment/hp/165xx/).

# Display Hardware Architecture

The logic analyzer has a CRT with a native resolution of 576x368 pixels. I'll dive into the details of this
CRT in a later blog post, but it's interesting to see what was driving such a luxurious high resolution
display in the early eighties.

* 256 KByte of dual-ported graphics DRAM

    576x368 = 212K pixels, so it looks like there's 1 byte reserved for each pixel.

    Built out of 8 instances of 64K x 4 bit [NEC D41264C-12 ICs](/assets/hp16500a/datasheets/NECED001-12A-1.pdf),
    the DRAMs are grouped as 4 banks of 32K bytes per bank.

    These dual-ported DRAMs make it much easier to design a frame buffer without needing to worry about interference 
    between the display scanout logic and the CPU. 

    As can be seen in the block diagram, the top half has a parallel, random access interface 
    that's pretty much identical to regular, single ported DRAM. The bottom part contains a shift register
    that has the size of a single DRAM row. A full row is copied into this register, and then shifted out 
    nibble by nibble.

    ![Dual ported DRAM block diagram](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/36_graphics_memory_block_diagram.jpg)

    Dual-ported DRAM chips were a thing until sometime in the nineties, but has since completely disappeared:
    they are signficantly more expensive, and the need for them has gone. With increasing clock speeds, the bandwidth 
    needed to read out pixels from the frame buffer became an ever smaller part of the overall bandwidth, and 
    the logic needed to arbitrate multiple agents was pulled into controller ICs.

* 8 4-bit parallel shift registers

    [74F195N 4-bit parallel-access shift registers](/assets/hp16500a/datasheets/74F195A.pdf) capture 
    the graphics DRAM output.

    These are part of a two-stage shift register architecture: the first stage are the shift registers inside
    the graphics DRAM. Since there are 8 of those in parallel, their outputs get in turn captured in this shift
    register and then shifted out "downwards" towards the RGB DAC.

* 3x 4-bit video DAC with 16 color palette

    The [NE5150F](/assets/hp16500a/datasheets/NE5150.pdf) takes in a 4 address bits to look up 
    the RGB data of one of 16 colors. Each color is 12 bits, 4 bits per color component. These RGB values
    are sent to 3 analog DACs.

    ![NE5150 block diagram](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/37_ne5150_block_diagram.png)

    You'd think that these 4 address bits are connected straight to a nibble from parallel shift register,
    but that doesn't seem to be the case. Because there's an additional SRAM that sits in between...

* 256 x 4 bits SRAM

    This RAM, a [CY7C122-25PC](/assets/hp16500a/datasheets/cy7c122.pdf), is a bit of a mystery:
    the DAC has a palette with 16 entries, good for 16 discrete RGB colors. And yet, this RAM seems to be sitting
    in between the parallel shift register and the DAC.

    Believe it or not, there is 
    [a HP 16500A MAME emulator](https://github.com/mamedev/mame/blob/master/src/mame/drivers/hp16500.cpp), which 
    confirms that theory: it has a 256-entry 
    [`m_palette`](https://github.com/mamedev/mame/blob/cd83335913a6cfe4aa2db720692fa34487b1d7a3/src/mame/drivers/hp16500.cpp#L112)
    variable that 
    [takes in an 8-bit value from the graphics RAM](https://github.com/mamedev/mame/blob/cd83335913a6cfe4aa2db720692fa34487b1d7a3/src/mame/drivers/hp16500.cpp#L405-L408) 
    to construct the output screen image.

    So what we have here is double lookup table: `DAC_palette[SRAM_palette[graphics_RAM[address]]]`.

    I have no idea why... It certainly doesn't increase the number of colors (the DAC only support 16), but 
    it's possible that there are some clever tricks that allow software to distinguish between graphics and
    text? I stared for quite some time at the disassembled EPROM code and the code that deals with the display
    controller has a lot of registers operations that deal with masking bits etc.


* CRT controller

    An [MC68A45](/assets/hp16500a/datasheets/mc68A45_datasheet.pdf) is the final piece
    of the display logic. While the previous chips were all part of the graphics data pipeline,
    this IC contains the main display control logic: video memory address generation and video timing generation 
    for signals such as vsync and hsync.

    The 6845 can also generate addresses for a character ROM (for those cases when you don't use a bitmapped
    video memory), but I don't think that functionality is being used by the 16500A: there's no character ROM
    on the board, and the EPROM code contains a character set in bitmap format.

# Communication Devices

* GPIB Controller

    A [TMS9914A](/assets/hp16500a/datasheets/TMS9914A_General_Purpose_Interface_Bus_Controller_Data_Manual_Dec82.pdf)
    is used as GPIB Controller.

    ![TMS9914A block diagram](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/38_tms9914a_block_diagram.jpg)

    It implements the GPIB protocol statemachine and thus relieves the CPU from having to take care of the 
    lower level GPIB logic details.

    It does not convert 5V TTL to the analog signalling requirements of the GPIB specification. For that, the
    HP16500A uses standard [DS75160A and DS75162A transceivers](/assets/hp16500a/datasheets/DS75160AN.pdf). (I've been trying to get those for months now on
    Mouser, but they're perenially out of stock...)

* Serial port controller

    An [SCN2661A](/assets/hp16500a/datasheets/SCN2661A.pdf) handles UART communication.
    RS-232 voltage level conversion is done by a [DS14C88N driver](/assets/hp16500a/datasheets/ds14c88.pdf)
    and a [DS14C89N receiver](/assets/hp16500a/datasheets/ds14c89a.pdf).

* Floppy drive controller

    Floppy drive control is handled by two chips: 
    a [FDC9793 Floppy Disk Controller/Formatter](/assets/hp16500a/datasheets/FDC97_datasheet.pdf) and a
    [FDC9229BT Floppy Disk Interface Circuit](/assets/hp16500a/datasheets/FCD9229BT.pdf).

# HP Human Interface Link Host Controller

Finally, there's the HP-HIL interface. HIL standards for Human Interface Link, an HP proprietary
serial communications protocol that allows connecting multiple external devices to one interface
port by daisy chaining them together.

HIL was used for all HP devices that, today, we'd call USB Human Interface Devices: keyboard,
mouse, buttons, touch screen, and so forth.

On the 16500A, the embedded touch screen counts as a one HIL device.  Further devices such as 
the keyboard can be plugged in the jack that's on the front panel.

HP created a number of ASICs for host and devices. The IC that is marked 1RD2-6001 is obviously
a host controller. The [June 1987 edition of HP Journal](http://www.hparchive.com/Journals/HPJ-1987-06.pdf)
has a block diagram of such a host controller:

![HP HIL host controller block diagram](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/40_HIL_master_block_diagram.jpg)

The HIL architecture is quite similar to the way one can daisy-chain multiple SPI devices, with 1 serial data
signal going out of the host and one serial data signal returning. The data rate is 100kHz. Unlike SPI, there
is no transmit clock, but like a UART, the bit rate is low enough to extract bits with even a low accuracy 
local clock.

![HP HIL signals loopback](/assets/hp16500a/blog_disassembly/42_HIL_signals.jpg)

Data is transmitted in frames of 15 bits: 3 address bits, 8 data bits, and start, stop, parity,
and command bits. With these 3 address bits, there can be a maximum of 8 devices connected to a single
HIL port.

The [HP-HIL Technical Reference Manual](http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/hp/hp-hil/45918A-90001_HP-HIL_Technical_Reference_Manual_Jan86.pdf)
explains not only the details of the protocol, but also the interface of the HP HIL ASICs.

# More Coming Up...

I've been playing around with the touchscreen, and that deserves its own write up. The CRT is also
a component that has received closer attention: I've already done some experiments, and some more
are still being worked on.

There's also a half-baked plan to replace the code of the boot EPROM with code of my own? Maybe run
a clone of PacMan on the 68000?

Maybe I'll even try to use logic analyzer for its original goal: observing signals under test?

So stay tuned for future installments!
