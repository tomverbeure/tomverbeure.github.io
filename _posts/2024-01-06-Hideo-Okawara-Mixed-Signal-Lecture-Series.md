# Introduction

While researching a DSP related topic, Google dug up an excellent article,
written by Hideo Okawara, that is just one part of a series of ~53. I was ready for more!

Originally written for Verigy, the series is now hosted by [Advantest](https://www.advantest.com/).
But hosting it pretty much where it ends. Each article has a link that's dedicated to the
series, but those Verigy links are now defunct. A search for "Hideo Okawara" using the
Advantest websites's search function will leave you empty handed, though that's not
surprising, corporate website search functions are universally terrible.

This is one of those cases where the tentacles of Google are a blessing: if it exists, 
chances are that they'll find it.

Advantest may not think it's worthwhile to catalog such a great learning resource, but I
certainly do, so I spent a good hour trying to find as many links as I could.

The result is below, 7 out of 53 articles are missing. If anyone finds a link to one of the 
missing ones, let me know!

The articles are usually short, light on math, focus on intuitive understanding of concepts 
and terminology, and often contain a concerete examples. While the code uses the API of 
Advantest test equipment, it's still a good starting point for your own experiments with numpy 
and scipy.

A great example is Episode 51, which talks about [CIC Decimation and FIR Filtering](https://www3.advantest.com/documents/11348/9be9d841-823a-4a04-a7cc-38629a78fe6c).
If I didn't know any better (and if that article wasn't written 8 years earlier), I could be
tricked into thinking that he copied this FFT plot from 
[one of my blog post](https://tomverbeure.github.io/2020/10/04/PDM-Microphones-and-Sigma-Delta-Conversion.html#from-analog-signal-to-pdm-with-a-sigma-delta-converter)!
