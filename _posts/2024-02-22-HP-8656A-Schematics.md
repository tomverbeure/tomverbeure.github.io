I'm currently doing some repair work my flea-market HP 8656A signal generator.

Agilent has made the *[8656A Signal Generator Operating & Service Manual](/assets/hp8656a/8656A Signal Generator Operating and Service Manual - 9018-05716.pdf)* 
available as a PDF, but the schematics of chapter 8 are all spread over 3 or 4 pages, which makes
them hard to follow.

I spent a good evening extracting the schematics pages, cutting-and-pasting
them together into single-page schematics, and then merging them in a new
schematics-only PDF file.

The result is here:  [8656A Signal Generator Operating and Service Manual - Chapter 8 Schematics.pdf](/assets/hp8656a/8656A Signal Generator Operating and Service Manual - Chapter 8 Schematics.pdf)

Enjoy!
