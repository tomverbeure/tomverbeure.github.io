# Introduction

If you've read my previous three posts in this series, you know that I'm improving my general DSP
knowledge by applying it to a concrete example of taking in the single-bit data stream of
a [PDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-density_modulation) microphone and converting it 
into standard [PCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-code_modulation) samples.

The application itself is only a means to an end. Most important is understanding the why and 
how of every design decision along the way: if there's, say, a filter with a 70dB stop band
attenuation at 10kHz, I want to know the justification for that.

After diving into [CIC filters](/2020/09/30/Moving-Average-and-CIC-Filters.html),
the characteristics of the 
[sigma-delta generated PDM signal of a MEMS microphone](/2020/10/04/PDM-Microphones-and-Sigma-Delta-Conversion.html), 
and [learning how to come up with FIR filter coefficients](/2020/10/11/Designing-Generic-FIR-Filters-with-pyFDA-and-Numpy.html)
in general, the time has come to start building up the filter architecture.

And for that, we need to come up with a design specification!

# Making Sense of Microphone Datasheet Numbers

The problem that I want to solve is to convert a PDM signal to a PCM signal while
maintaining the quality level of the microphone.

Going forward, I'll use the characteristics of the ST MP34DT01-M microphone of my
[Adafruit test board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3492) and let them guide
the specifications of the filter design.

ST seems to have left the PDM microphone market, but luckily, Adafruit still carries
[the datasheet](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/049/977/original/MP34DT01-M.pdf).
The most important characteristics are marked in red:

![Microphone Characteristics Table](/assets/pdm/datasheet_specs/mic_characteristics.png)

When I see "SNR" and "AD converter", I think "dynamic range" and the number of bits that
I need to make sure that my logic can cover the full signal range: 1 bit is good for ~6dB.

For example, 16-bit CD quality audio supports 
[a theoretical maximum SNR of 96dB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_bit_depth#Quantization).

So when the datasheet of my microphone showed an SNR of 61dB(A), I initially assumed that you 
get what you pay for: a cheap device with crappy dynamic range.

And I couldn't have been more wrong!

If you want the gory details, you should read the [Microphone Specifications Explained](https://invensense.tdk.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AN-1112-v1.1.pdf)
application note from InvenSense.  Another good (and shorter) document is Infineon's 
[Digital encoding requirements for high dynamic range microphones](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-AN556%20Digital%20encoding%20requirements%20for%20high%20dynamic%20range%20microphones-AN-v01_00-EN.pdf?fileId=5546d4626102d35a01612d1e33876ad8),
which discusses the relationship between microphone specifications and the word size needed to
capture the full dynamic range of a microphone. (Just what I need!)

But I'll give a very short summary here.

**Acoustic Overload Point**

A microphone datasheet lists the loudest 1kHz sine wave that it can more or less reliably record. This is called
the acoustic overload point (AOP). A common way to quantify "reliably record" is with a 
[total harmonic distortion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_harmonic_distortion) (THD) of 10%
or less.

Our microphone has an AOP of 120 dbSPL, where dbSPL stands for decibel 
[sound pressure level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_pressure).

It also shows that 120 dbSPL corresponds to a THD of 10%:

![Microphone THD](/assets/pdm/datasheet_specs/mic_thd.png)

According to Wikipedia, 120 dbSPL is about as loud as having the bane of the 2010 World Cup, 
the [vuvuzela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vuvuzela), screaming at you from a 1m distance.

![Vuvuzela](/assets/pdm/datasheet_specs/vuvuzela.jpg)

The digital output of a microphone should be at maximum at the AOP. This is full-scale value. All
other sounds (with some exceptions) will result in a lower digital output value. The unit to measure this is 
[dbFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBFS), decibels relative to
full scale. At the AOP, dbFS is 0. All other levels have a negative dbFS number.

**Signal to Noise Ratio**

The signal to noise ratio of a microphone quantifies the internal noise of the microphone, and thus
the boundary for which sound can be recorded. 

However, the number is not relative to the AOP but to a 1kHz sine wave with a sound pressure of
94 dBSPL. Don't get confused by the fact that our datasheet lists SNR for a sound pressure of 1 Pa: that
corresponds exactly to 94dBSPL.

The SNR measurement goes as follows:

* first they record the output of the microphone with this 1kHz 94dBSPL reference sine wave
* then they put the microphone is a fully silent environment, and record the output again. This
  noise output is corrected by an [A-weighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-weighting) curve,
  which adjust for the human ear's frequency sensitivity. 
* finally, they subtract these 2 numbers.

**Dynamic Range**

We now have 2 numbers: AOP, which is the maximum sound pressure, and SNR, which is relative
to a sound pressure of 94dBSPL.

The dynamic range of the microphone is the SNR plus the difference between the AOP and 94dbSPL.

In our case: 120dBSPL (AOP) - 94dBSPL (SNR reference) + 61dB (SNR) = 87dB.

![Microphone Dynamic Range](/assets/pdm/datasheet_specs/datasheet_specs-mic_aop_and_snr.svg)

At ~6dB per bit, our design will need a PCM word size of at least 15 bits to cover the full dynamic range 
of the microphone. The desired dynamic range also impacts the performance parameters of the filters that are 
needed for PDM to PCM signal conversion.

# PDM to PCM Design Requirements

We can finally move on the requirements of our design:

* An output sample rate of 48kHz.

    48kHz is universally supported and probably the most common sample rate for high quality audio, 
    though it's obviously overkill for a microphone that only goes up to 10kHz.

* 2.304 MHz PDM sample rate.

    The microphone supports a PDM clock rate between 1 and 3.25MHz. 

    There are some very efficient filters that are perfect for 2x decimation, 
    so it's best to select a ratio that is divisable by some power of 2.

    The acoustic and electrical characteristics in the datasheet are given for 2.4MHz, 
    but 2400/48=50, which is only divisable by 2.  So let's choose 2.304MHz: 2304/48=48, which
    is in turn divisable by 16. Perfect!

* A passband from 0 to 6kHz.

    Some MEMS microphones have a sensitivity curve that goes all the way up to 20kHz, but this 
    microphone definitely does not fall in that category. The frequency
    response is only flat between 100Hz and 5kHz, after which it starts going up. And
    there's no data above 10kHz.

    ![Microphone Frequency Response](/assets/pdm/datasheet_specs/mic_freq_response.png)

    6kHz seems like a good point to start the transition band.

* A stop band that starts at 10kHz.

    Since the specification of the microphone doesn't say anything about behavior above
    10kHz, I'm simply assuming that this is no-go territory, so that's where the
    stop band will start.

* An output signal with a SNR of 86dB.

    In the previous section, I derived a microphone dynamic range of 87dB.

    Decimation will alias higher frequencies into the final frequency band. Since perfect
    filters don't exist, the noise of the stop band will inevitably reduce the SNR of the 
    final signal.

    I'm allowing a 1dB SNR deterioration, which is not a lot, and it will put quite
    a bit of strain onto the filter design. This will soon be discussed in depth.

* The maximum ripple I'm willing to accept in the passband at the output is 0.1dB.

    This seems to be a pretty typical requirement for high quality audio.

    In a decimation filter architecture with more than 1 filter, each successive filter will impact the
    passband ripple. As a result, individual filters will need to have a tighter specification
    than this overall ripple.

# Stop Band Attenuation for a Decimation Filter

I already wrote about the 
[Basics of Decimation](/2020/09/30/Moving-Average-and-CIC-Filters.html#intermission-the-basics-of-decimation)
earlier, but didn't mention one of the most important parts:

**Higher decimation ratios require higher stop band attenuation to get the same noise floor.**

In the example below, you can see what happens when you keep the stop band attenuation of
a decimation filter the same for different decimation ratios:

![Stop Band Attenuation and Decimation](/assets/pdm/datasheet_specs/datasheet_specs-stop_band_attenuation.svg)

Of interest here is the amount of unwanted aliasing noise (red) that is added underneath the
signal of interest (green) after decimation. In the 2x decimation case, only 1 'unit' of stop band
noise is added, while it's 3x that for the 4x decimation case. In general, the amount of noise
added is *(n-1)*, where *n* is the decimation ratio, 48 in our case.

Once noise ends up in the frequency range of the signal of interest, it can never be removed.

If we want the amount of aliasing noise to be the same for the 2x and the 4x decimation, 
we have to increase the stop band attenuation of the 4x decimation filter by 3x compared to the
2x decimation filter.

Let's now work the numbers for our microphone case.

* microphone dynamic range: 87dB.

* output dynamic range: 86dB.

* decimation ratio: 48x.

* PDM noise level above 24kHz: -20dB or less

    This is almost certainly wrong, but I expect it to be pessimistic with some additional
    margin.

    Recall the noise slopes of various sigma-delta converters from my 
    [earlier blog post](/2020/10/04/PDM-Microphones-and-Sigma-Delta-Conversion.html#high-frequency-noise-level-depends-on-sigma-delta-order):

    ![Sigma Delta Noise Slopes](/assets/pdm/sigma_delta/noise_slope_different_orders.svg)

    The noise floor here does not go above -30dB.

* Difference between input and output dynamic range: 1dB (87dB - 86dB)

* Number of upper frequency bands that are aliased onto the main signal: 47 (48-1)

* Combined power of the aliased noise if there's no filter: -3dB

    ```
    P_aliasing_noise_before = 10^(-20dB/10) * 47 
    P_aliasing_noise_before_db = -20dB + 10*log10(47)
    P_aliasing_noise_before_db = -20dB + 17dB = -3dB.
    ```

* Required stop band attenuation: 89dB

    ```
    SNR_signal_before + P_aliasing_noise_after = SNR_signal_after

    10^(-87/10) + 10^(P_aliasing_noise_after_db/10) = 10^(-86/10)
    10^(P_aliasing_noise_after_db/10) = 10^(-86/10) - 10^(-87/10) 
    P_aliasing_noise_after_db = 10 * log10( 10^(-86/10) - 10^(-87/10) )
    P_aliasing_noise_after_db = -92dB 
    A_stop_band = P_aliasing_noise_before    / P_aliasing_noise_after
    A_stop_band = P_aliasing_noise_before_db - P_aliasing_noise_after_db
    A_stop_band = -3dB - (-92dB) = 89dB
    ```

# PDM to PCM First Try: Just Filter the Damn Thing!

Do we really need a complex filter architecture to convert PDM to PCM? Maybe a single equiripple
filter is sufficient for our needs?

Let's just fill in the numbers, run the `remez` algorithm that was discussed in 
[my previous blog post](/2020/10/11/Designing-Generic-FIR-Filters-with-pyFDA-and-Numpy.html#finding-the-optimal-filter-order),
and see what happens:

```
...
Trying N=2212
Rpb: 0.013681dB
Rsb: 88.912090dB
Trying N=2213
Rpb: 0.013842dB
Rsb: 88.953522dB
Trying N=2214
Rpb: 0.013998dB
Rsb: 88.987672dB
Trying N=2215
Rpb: 0.014158dB
Rsb: 89.034898dB
Filter order: 2215

```

After more than a little while, it comes up with a filter that has 2216 taps, and the following
frequency response graph:

![Just Filter the Damn Thing - Frequency Response](/assets/pdm/datasheet_specs/filter_the_damn_thing.svg)

Since this is a decimation filter, we only need to evaluate it for each output sample.

The number of multiplications per second becomes:

```
48000 * 2216 = 106M muls/s          (48x decimation - from 2304 to 48kHz)
```

That's a lot, but that's good if you're looking for a baseline and want to impress people 
about how you were able to optimize your design!

![Just Filter the Damn Thing - Impulse Response](/assets/pdm/datasheet_specs/filter_the_damn_thing_impulse.svg)

Note that even if the remez function seems to have found a solution, upon closer look, the
result looks suspicous: the very first coefficient (and the very last one, since it's symmetric) have
a weird bump. 

I suspect that this due to rounding errors. So even if you can stomach the 110M multiplications/s, chances 
are that the result won't be right. (I didn't pursue this further.)

# Conclusion

We have finally have a design specification and can now start looking at practical design implementations.

A naive first try at solving everything with a single filter didn't work out, but there a lot of ways
to optimize the design into something that will work.
