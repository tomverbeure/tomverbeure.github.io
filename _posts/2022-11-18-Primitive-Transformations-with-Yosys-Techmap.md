# Introduction

If you're reading this you probably already know that [Yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys)
is an open source logic synthesis tool. You may also know that it's much more than that: in
my [earlier blog post about CXXRTL](/2020/08/08/CXXRTL-the-New-Yosys-Simulation-Backend.html)
I call it the *swiss army knife of digital logic manipulation*. 

In most cases, using Yosys
means running pre-made scripts that contain Yosys commands: when I'm synthesizing RTL for an FPGA of the 
Lattice iCE40 family, the [`synth_ice40` command](https://yosyshq.readthedocs.io/projects/yosys/en/latest/cmd/synth_ice40.html) is 
usually sufficient to convert my RTL into a netlist that can be sent straight to 
[nextpnr](https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr)
for place, route, and bitstream creation.

My current version of Yosys has 232 commands, and many of these commands have an impressive list 
of additional options, but sometimes you want to perform very particular logic operations that 
don't come standard with the tool.

In this blog post, I'll talk about the [`techmap` command](https://yosyshq.readthedocs.io/projects/yosys/en/latest/cmd/techmap.html), 
a particularly powerful command that allows one to make custom logic transformations by replacing a 
logic cell instance of a given type to one or more different ones. 

# Mapping a multiplication to an FPGA DSP Cell

*There is a companion [yosys_techmap_blog project on GitHub](https://github.com/tomverbeure/yosys_techmap_blog)
that contains the Verilog source files and the scripts to generate the graphics and Yosys results
of this blog post.*

A good example of a `techmap` operation is one where a generic multiplication
is converted into a DSP block of an FPGA. For those who are unfamiliar with the technology,
FPGAs usually have only a few core logic primitives: lookup-table cells (LUTs) are used to construct
any kind of random logic circuit, RAM cells are, well, RAMs, and DSPs are larger cells that contain one
or more hardware multipliers, often in combination with an accumulator.

Let's look at this Verilog module, [`mul.v`](https://github.com/tomverbeure/yosys_techmap_blog/blob/main/mul.v), 
that multiplies two 10-bit values into a 20-bit result:

```verilog
module top(input [9:0] op0, input [9:0] op1, output [19:0] result);
    assign result = op0 * op1;
endmodule
```

When reading in the Verilog file, Yosys translates it into RTLIL (RTL Internal Language), 
the internal representation of the design. The multiplication operation becomes a `$mul` primitive,
and the whole design looks like this:

```
module \top
  wire width 10 input 1 \op0
  wire width 10 input 2 \op1
  wire width 20 output 3 \result
  cell $mul $mul$mul.v:3$1
    parameter \A_SIGNED 0
    parameter \A_WIDTH 10
    parameter \B_SIGNED 0
    parameter \B_WIDTH 10
    parameter \Y_WIDTH 20
    connect \A \op0
    connect \B \op1
    connect \Y \result
  end
```

Yosys has the super useful [`show` command](https://yosyshq.readthedocs.io/projects/yosys/en/latest/cmd/show.html) 
that renders an RTLIL representation as a graph. I usually add the `-width -signed` options to 
annotate signals with their size and to show which cell ports are signed:

![top module as a graph with $mul instance](/assets/yosys_techmap/mul_rtlil.png)

This primitive must be converted into cells of the target technology. Most FPGAs from the
iCE40 family have a handful of DSPs. When you synthesize this module to the iCE40 technology with
`synth_ice40 -dsp`, the `$mul` primitive gets converted to an `SB_MAC16` cell which is the DSP 
primitive of the iCE40 family.

[![SB_MAC16 internal block diagram](/assets/yosys_techmap/SB_MAC16_block_diagram.png)](/assets/yosys_techmap/SB_MAC16_block_diagram.png)

The `SB_MAC16` DSP has a ton of data path and configuration signals, and the multiplier inputs and 
output can be up to 16 and 32-bits wide respectively. It's up to a `techmap` step to assign all the right 
values to the configuration signals, and to correctly tie down unused input data bits or ignore excess 
output bits so that the DSP performs the desired 10-bit x 10-bit multiplication.

After cleaning up some irrelevant cruft, the post-synthesis RTLIL looks like this:

```

  wire width 10 input 2 \op1
  wire width 20 output 3 \result

  end
end
```

And here's the equivalent graphical representation. (*Click to enlarge*)

[![top module as a graph after synthesis](/assets/yosys_techmap/mul_ice40.png)](/assets/yosys_techmap/mul_ice40.png)

All Yosys commands are written in C++, but in the case of `techmap` the specific mapping
operations are described in... Verilog! It's a very neat system that makes it possible for
anyone to create their own custom mapping operations without the need to touch a line of C++.

Let's see exactly how that works for our example, and look at the source code of the `synth_ice40` command.

Yosys places all the technology-specific operations under the [`techlibs`](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/tree/master/techlibs) 
directory. The code for `synth_ice40` can be found in 
[`techlibs/ice40/synth_ice40.cc`](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/blob/master/techlibs/ice40/synth_ice40.cc).
`synth_ice40` doesn't really have any smarts by itself: it's a macro command, a series of lower level
Yosys commands strung together into a recipe. 

When you run `help synth_ice40` in Yosys, you'll see the following command line option:

```
    -dsp
        use iCE40 UltraPlus DSP cells for large arithmetic
```

It's easy to see [which steps are activated in the source code](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/blob/853f4bb3c695d9f5183ef5064ec4cf9cdd8b5300/techlibs/ice40/synth_ice40.cc#L329-L341) when DSP mapping is enabled:

```c
run("memory_dff" + no_rw_check_opt); // ice40_dsp will merge registers, reserve memory port registers first
run("wreduce t:$mul");
run("techmap -map +/mul2dsp.v -map +/ice40/dsp_map.v -D DSP_A_MAXWIDTH=16 -D DSP_B_MAXWIDTH=16 "
    "-D DSP_A_MINWIDTH=2 -D DSP_B_MINWIDTH=2 -D DSP_Y_MINWIDTH=11 "
    "-D DSP_NAME=$__MUL16X16", "(if -dsp)");
run("select a:mul2dsp", "              (if -dsp)");
run("setattr -unset mul2dsp", "        (if -dsp)");
run("opt_expr -fine", "                (if -dsp)");
run("wreduce", "                       (if -dsp)");
run("select -clear", "                 (if -dsp)");
run("ice40_dsp", "                     (if -dsp)");
run("chtype -set $mul t:$__soft_mul", "(if -dsp)");
```

There's quite a bit going on here, but the most interesting command is this one:

```
    techmap -map +/mul2dsp.v -map +/ice40/dsp_map.v 
        -D DSP_A_MAXWIDTH=16 -D DSP_B_MAXWIDTH=16
        -D DSP_A_MINWIDTH=2 -D DSP_B_MINWIDTH=2 -D DSP_Y_MINWIDTH=11
        -D DSP_NAME=$__MUL16X16
```

What we see here is that `techmap` is performing the `$mul` to `SB_MAC16` conversion in two steps:

1. convert `$mul` to a generic, technology independent DSP multiplier cell.
2. convert the generic multiplier DSP cell to an iCE40 DSP cell.

**Step 1: mul2dsp.v**

Step 1 is done by [`mul2dsp.v`](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/blob/master/techlibs/common/mul2dsp.v).
The code is a bit convoluted, but it has the answer as to why there's this intermediate step:

* it deals with cases where a single `$mul` operation requires more than one DSP.

    For example, a 32-bit x 32-bit to 64-bit multiplication is split into 4 
    16x16=32 multiplications and some additions.

* it doesn't do the conversion when the inputs of the multiplication are too small 

    This avoids wasting precious DSP resources on something that can be implemented with core logic.
  
The `-D ...` arguments of the `techmap` command specify Verilog defines that are passed to the techmap
file. It's used to parameterize the conversion process:

* `-D DSP_A_MAXWIDTH=16 -D DSP_B_MAXWIDTH=16` informs `mul2dsp` that the maximum input size of
  the DSP is 16 bits.
* `-D DSP_A_MINWIDTH=2 -D DSP_B_MINWIDTH=2 -D DSP_Y_MINWIDTH=11` provides the minimum requirements
  that must be satisfied to do the conversion.
* `-D DSP_NAME=$__MUL16X16` provides the name of the generic multiplier cells that should be created.

We can run that first step by ourselves and check the result:

```
read_verilog mul.v
clean -purge
techmap -map +/mul2dsp.v -D DSP_A_MAXWIDTH=16 -D DSP_B_MAXWIDTH=16 -D DSP_A_MINWIDTH=2 -D DSP_B_MINWIDTH=2 -D DSP_Y_MINWIDTH=11 -D DSP_NAME=$__MUL16X16
clean -purge
show -width -signed -format png -prefix mul_mul2dsp
```

![top module after mul2dsp phase](/assets/yosys_techmap/mul_mul2dsp.png)

In case you were wondering, here's what this first step looks like for a 20-bit x 20-bit to 40-bit multiplier:

*(Click to enlarge)*

Yosys can often create very long internal labels that stretch the graphical representation, so
I zoomed the image to the part that counts. The 3 red rectangles are the `$__MUL16X16` cells that will be converted
to iCE40 DSPs. The blue rectangle is a `$__soft_mul` cell that will be converted into random logic
at a large stage, and the 3 green rectangles are `$add` cells to bring the results of the different multipliers
together.

**Step 2: ice40/dsp_map.v**

Step 2 of the `techmap` process, [`ice40/dsp_map.v`](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/blob/master/techlibs/ice40/dsp_map.v) 
is trivial: it converts the generic `$__MUL16X16` multiplier cell into an `SB_MAC16` cell, wires up the data path inputs and output,
and straps all the other configuration inputs so that the cell is configured as a straight 
multiplier.

```verilog
module \$__MUL16X16 (input [15:0] A, input [15:0] B, output [31:0] Y);
	parameter A_SIGNED = 0;
	parameter B_SIGNED = 0;
	parameter A_WIDTH = 0;
	parameter B_WIDTH = 0;
	parameter Y_WIDTH = 0;

	);
endmodule
```

# A Horribly Contrived Example Problem

Have a look at the following Verilog example code:

```verilog
module top_unsigned(input [5:0] op0, input [6:0] op1, output [63:0] sum);
    assign sum = op0 + op1;
endmodule
```

The graphical representation is as expected:

![top_unsigned original version](/assets/yosys_techmap/add_orig.png)

I sometimes use [CXXRTL](/2020/08/08/CXXRTL-the-New-Yosys-Simulation-Backend.html) to simulate my designs.
When I run `write_cxxrtl`, the generated file contains the following:

```c
bool p_top__unsigned::eval() {
	bool converged = true;
	p_sum0 = add_uu<64>(p_op0, p_op1);
	return converged;
}
```

This is exactly as expected, and there's nothing wrong with it. But one thing that bothers me is that CXXRTL 
uses 32-bit integer values ("chunks") for all its operations. In the code above, there's a 64-bit addition, and
CXXRTL implements those by 
[splitting things up into multiple 32-bit additions](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/blob/853f4bb3c695d9f5183ef5064ec4cf9cdd8b5300/backends/cxxrtl/cxxrtl.h#L521-L532):

```c
   template<bool Invert, bool CarryIn>
   std::pair<value<Bits>, bool /*CarryOut*/> alu(const value<Bits> &other) const {
      value<Bits> result;
      bool carry = CarryIn;
      for (size_t n = 0; n < result.chunks; n++) {
         result.data[n] = data[n] + (Invert ? ~other.data[n] : other.data[n]) + carry;
         if (result.chunks - 1 == n)
            result.data[result.chunks - 1] &= result.msb_mask;
         carry = (result.data[n] <  data[n]) ||
                 (result.data[n] == data[n] && carry);
      }
      return {result, carry};
   }
```

It's a hand-crafted carry-ripple adder. Now, don't worry, things are really not as bad as it seems,
because all the variables that are used for the `if` conditionals and the `for` loop are constants. Any
good C++ compiler will optimize the addition above into only a few assembler instructions.

If you know your binary adder basics, you see that the addition of a 7-bit and a 6 bit operand will result
at most in an 8-bit result. All higher bits will always be 0. It's overkill to have a 64-bit adder.

Yosys already has the [`wreduce` command](https://yosyshq.readthedocs.io/projects/yosys/en/latest/cmd/wreduce.html) that reduces logic 
operations to just the number of bits that are really needed.

We can see this when we run the following commands:

```
read_verilog add.v
hierarchy -top top_unsigned
wreduce
clean -purge
```

![top_unsigned after wreduce](/assets/yosys_techmap/add_wreduce.png)

And here's the relevant CXXRTL generated code:

```c
bool p_top__unsigned::eval() {
    bool converged = true;
    p_sum0.slice<7,0>() = add_uu<8>(p_op0, p_op1);
    p_sum0.slice<63,8>() = value<56>{0u,0u};
    return converged;
}
```

That looks better, but is that really true? The addition returns an 8-bit value, but since
the smallest chunk is 32-bits, the `slice<7,0>` command now requires a read-modify-write
operation.

What I really want is this:

```c
bool p_top__unsigned::eval() {
    bool converged = true;
    p_sum0.slice<31,0>() = add_uu<32>(p_op0, p_op1);    <<<<< 32 bits
    p_sum0.slice<63,32>() = value<32>{0u,0u};		<<<<< 32 bits
    return converged;
}
```

Unfortunately, Yosys doesn't have a command that does this for me, and I really don't
want to modify the [C++ code of the `wreduce` command](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/blob/master/passes/opt/wreduce.cc)
to make it so.

# A Custom Techmap Transformation to the Rescue!

If you start Yosys, running `help techmap` will give you an exhaustive list of all the features that
you might ever need. But instead of repeating everything in there, let's create an `add_reduce` techmap
transformation to solve the problem of the previous section.

Here are some of the basics of a techmap transformation Verilog module:

* a techmap transformation only operates on a single design cell. 

    You can not use `techmap` to perform multi-cell optimizations such mapping a `$mul` followed 
    by an `$add` onto an FPGA DSP has multiply-accumulator support.

* a design cell that is transformed by a techmap is selected by a string that contains a list of cell 
  types that are specified with the `(* techmap_celltype "...")` attribute. If the techmap module doesn't have
  such an attribute, then it's determined by the name of the Verilog module.

* by default, a techmap operation will iterate on itself until there's nothing left that matches.

    If a techmap operation replaces an `$add` primitive by a new `$add` primitive, techmap will run again 
    on the second one. Without some kind of abort mechanism, this will result in an endless loop!

    There are multiple ways to avoid such an endless loop though. I'll get to that later.

* it's always a good idea to normalize the configuration on which you want to do the main transformation.

    Here's a good example of what I mean by that: we want to reduce the size of an adder
    based on the size of its inputs. But an adder has 2 inputs, and if these inputs have a different
    size, then the transformation will have a different code path depending on which input is largest.

    However, an addition is commutative: the order of the inputs doesn't matter.

    It's easier first do a normalization where the A input is guaranteed to be larger or equal than
    the B input by swapping the inputs, so that actual reduction transformation only has to deal with one case.

    The earlier discussed `mul2dsp` techmap module 
    [does the same thing](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/blob/master/techlibs/common/mul2dsp.v#L97-L108).
    

**The add_reduce techmap module declaration**

In this example, I want a transformation that only works on an `$add` instance, so I could 
create a techmap Verilog module like this:

```verilog
module \$add(A, B, Y);
    ...
```

But I prefer to use a descriptive name for the module and use the `(* techmap_celltype ...)` option to select
the cell types on which the module operates:

```verilog
(* techmap_celltype "$add" *)
module add_reduce(A, B, Y);
    ...
```

**The add_reduce techmap module interface**

The techmap module interface should be the same as the cell on which it operates. Both the
input/output signals and the parameters must be the same. Yosys has a Verilog file called 
[`simlib.v`](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/blob/master/techlibs/common/simlib.v) that
contains the reference simulation modules of all its internal primitives. You can use
this to check out the interface details of particular primitive.  

Here's [the one for the `$add` primitive](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/blob/master/techlibs/common/simlib.v#L834-L844)

```verilog
module \$add (A, B, Y);

parameter A_SIGNED = 0;
parameter B_SIGNED = 0;
parameter A_WIDTH = 0;
parameter B_WIDTH = 0;
parameter Y_WIDTH = 0;

input [A_WIDTH-1:0] A;
input [B_WIDTH-1:0] B;
output [Y_WIDTH-1:0] Y;
```

The `add_reduce` techmap module has the same interface:

```verilog
(* techmap_celltype = "$add" *)
module add_reduce (A, B, Y);
	parameter A_SIGNED = 0;
	parameter B_SIGNED = 0;
	parameter A_WIDTH = 1;
	parameter B_WIDTH = 1;
	parameter Y_WIDTH = 1;

	(* force_downto *)
	input [A_WIDTH-1:0] A;
	(* force_downto *)
	input [B_WIDTH-1:0] B;
	(* force_downto *)
	output [Y_WIDTH-1:0] Y;

```

The `force_downto` attribute ensures that the highest numbered bit of each signal is
the MSB. When this attribute is present, Yosys will automatically swap around the bits of connected
wires so that you don't need to worry about wackos who use bit 0 as MSB.

**add_reduce stop conditions**

Since we're replacing an `$add` primitive with another `$add` primitive, we need to make sure that
there are special conditions to prevent the `techmap` operation to run forever.

We can tell the `techmap` command to stop transforming the current cell instance
by assigning a non-zero value to the `_TECHMAP_FAIL_` wire:

```verilog
    wire _TECHMAP_FAIL_ = 1;    
```

For this operation, we want stop transforming an `$add` primitive for a number of conditions:

* when the size of the adder is already equal or smaller than the minimal desired adder.

    We can set the minimum size with the \`Y_MIN_WIDTH define.

* When the size of the adder can't be reduced because it would change the result of the calculation.
* When it's a signed addition and we only want to transform unsigned additions.

    The \`REDUCE_SIGNED define must be set to allow signed adder transformation.

This translates into the following code:

```verilog
    localparam SIGNED_ADDER = (A_SIGNED == 1 && B_SIGNED == 1);

    generate 
        if (Y_WIDTH <= `Y_MIN_WIDTH) begin
            wire _TECHMAP_FAIL_ = 1;    
        end
        else if (Y_WIDTH <= A_WIDTH+1) begin
            wire _TECHMAP_FAIL_ = 1;    
        end
        else if (SIGNED_ADDER && !`REDUCE_SIGNED) begin
            wire _TECHMAP_FAIL_ = 1;    
        end
        ...
```

There are other ways to prevent `techmap` to run forever.  For example, in the `mul2dsp.v` code, 
a `$__soft_mul` cell used instead of a `$mul` primitive. Yosys has no such primitive, but
in a later step, after `techmap` has been completed, this `$__soft_mul` cell is converted
back to a `$mul$` cell:

```
chtype -set $mul t:$__soft_mul
```

**add_reduce normalization**

The normalization code of `add_reduce` is pretty much a straight copy of the one
from `mul2dsp`:

```verilog
    generate 
	...
	else if (B_WIDTH > A_WIDTH) begin
            \$add #(
                .A_SIGNED(B_SIGNED), <<< A and B are swapped
                .B_SIGNED(A_SIGNED), <<<
                .A_WIDTH(B_WIDTH),   <<<
                .B_WIDTH(A_WIDTH),   <<<
                .Y_WIDTH(Y_WIDTH)
            ) _TECHMAP_REPLACE_ (
                .A(B),               <<<
                .B(A),               <<<
                .Y(Y)
            );
	end
	else if ...
```

When using `_TECHMAP_REPLACE_` as instance name of the swapped `$add` primitive, it
will inherit the instance name of the original instance. This is one of the 
many predefined variables that are explained by running `help techmap` in Yosys.

Since we replace `$add` with `$add`, running `techmap` will result in the
`$add` cell being transformed twice times if B is larger than A: the first time
to swap the inputs, and the second time for the actual reduction.

If `techmap` needs to transform the same cell multiple times, it can
be hard to debug. You can use the `-max_iter <number>` option to limit
the number of transformations.

For example, here's what the design originally looked like:

![top_unsigned original version](/assets/yosys_techmap/add_orig.png)

And here's how things look when stopping the `add_reduce` operation after the 
first iteration:

```
techmap -map add_reduce.v -max_iter 1
clean -purge
```

![top_unsigned after swapping inputs](/assets/yosys_techmap/add_swap_clean.png)

`op1` with the largest input size of 7 is now connected to A!

**The actual add_reduce transformation**

Now that all preliminary formalities are behind use, the actual reduction
code is pretty straightfoward:

```verilog
else begin
    localparam ADDER_WIDTH  = `MAX(`Y_MIN_WIDTH, A_WIDTH+1);

    \$add #(
        .A_SIGNED(A_SIGNED), 
        .B_SIGNED(B_SIGNED), 
        .A_WIDTH(A_WIDTH),
        .B_WIDTH(B_WIDTH),
        .Y_WIDTH(ADDER_WIDTH)
    ) _TECHMAP_REPLACE_ (
        .A(A), 
        .B(B), 
        .Y(Y[ADDER_WIDTH-1:0]) 	// Reduced output size
    );
    // Higher bits are 0 or sign extension
    assign Y[Y_WIDTH-1:ADDER_WIDTH] = { (Y_WIDTH-ADDER_WIDTH){SIGNED_ADDER ? Y[ADDER_WIDTH-1] : 1'b0} };
end
```

The final `add_reduce.v` code can be found [here](https://github.com/tomverbeure/yosys_techmap_blog/blob/main/add_reduce.v).
We can run the whole thing with:

```
techmap -map add_reduce.v -D Y_MIN_WIDTH=32
clean -purge
```

The result is exactly what we wanted, as shown in the graphical diagram...

![top_unsigned after custom reduce](/assets/yosys_techmap/add_reduce.png)

...and in the CXXRTL-generated code:

```c
bool p_top__unsigned::eval() {
	bool converged = true;
	p_sum0.slice<31,0>() = add_uu<32>(p_op1, p_op0);
	p_sum0.slice<63,32>() = value<32>{0u};
	return converged;
}
```

# Formal Equivalence Check

Whenever you do logic transformations, it's not a bad idea to check that the pre- and 
post-transformation logic behaves exactly the same. Yosys has a basic built-in equivalence
checker. It's not a performance monster, but it's good enough for this kind of use case.

In the example below, I'm verifying the `add_reduce` techmap on a design with an adder that
has an output that's 10 instead of 64 bits, and the minimum size is set to 8.
This makes the size of the graphs more managable.

```
# Load the original design
read_verilog add.v
hierarchy -top top_unsigned10
rename top_unsigned10 top_unsigned

# Make a golden reference copy of the unmodified design
copy top_unsigned top_unsigned_gold

# Select the original version to do the techmap
select top_unsigned

# Do the techmap on top_unsigned
techmap -map add_reduce.v -D Y_MIN_WIDTH=8 
clean -purge
```

So far, so good: Yosys now has 2 designs. `top_unsigned_gold` is the original one: 

![top_unsigned10 golden](/assets/yosys_techmap/add10_gold.png)

And `top_unsigned` has been transformed with the techmap: 

![top_unsigned10 reduce](/assets/yosys_techmap/add10_reduce.png)


Let's compare them:

```
equiv_make top_unsigned_gold top_unsigned top_equiv
select top_equiv
```

The `equiv_make` has the golden and the transformed design as input and creates a new
design with `$equiv` primitive cells inserted at the output of both designs. These cells
will tell the equivalence checker which nets to check for formal equivalence. The
new design `top_equiv` looks like this:

[![top_unsigned10 equiv_make](/assets/yosys_techmap/add10_equiv_make.png)](/assets/yosys_techmap/add10_equiv_make.png)
*(Click to enlarge)*

As you can see, the new design has both the golden and the transformed logic on the left,
driven by the same inputs. For there are 10 `$equiv` cells, one for each bit of the output.

We can now run the equivalence check:

```
equiv_simple
```

You'll see something like this:

```
8. Executing EQUIV_SIMPLE pass.
Found 10 unproven $equiv cells (1 groups) in top_equiv:
 Grouping SAT models for \sum0:
  Trying to prove $equiv for \sum0 [0]: success!
  Trying to prove $equiv for \sum0 [1]: success!
  Trying to prove $equiv for \sum0 [2]: success!
  Trying to prove $equiv for \sum0 [3]: success!
  Trying to prove $equiv for \sum0 [4]: success!
  Trying to prove $equiv for \sum0 [5]: success!
  Trying to prove $equiv for \sum0 [6]: success!
  Trying to prove $equiv for \sum0 [7]: success!
  Trying to prove $equiv for \sum0 [8]: success!
  Trying to prove $equiv for \sum0 [9]: success!
Proved 10 previously unproven $equiv cells.
```

Each individual bit has been proven to be correct.

We can make Yosys fail if there were any unproven `$equiv` cells, like this:

```
equiv_status -assert
```

However, in our case, all is well:

```
9. Executing EQUIV_STATUS pass.
Found 10 $equiv cells in top_equiv:
  Of those cells 10 are proven and 0 are unproven.
  Equivalence successfully proven!
```

We've now proven that our `add_reduce` techmap is correct, but that doesn't mean
it's guaranteed bug free: we've only tested one combination of input and output
signal sizes. To be absolutely sure, you'd need more variety of test cases.

This is only a quick example of what Yosys can do, there's a variety of additional 
equivalence and logic proof features, most of which I don't know much about! You
could start by checking out the help information for the `equiv_*`, `miter`, and `sat` 
commands to learn more.

# Cleaning Up

When Yosys creates new cells and reconnects wires, it won't immediately delete older cells and wires
that aren't used anymore. You need to expliclity tell Yosys to do so with the `clean -purge`
command that you can see in some of the command sequences above.

Here's what the reduced adder looks like without first running a clean:

![top_unsigned after custom reduce without clean](/assets/yosys_techmap/add_reduce_unclean.png)

That's why you see a `clean -purge` statement all over the place 
[in the script](https://github.com/tomverbeure/yosys_techmap_blog/blob/main/add_reduce.yosys)
generates all the pretty pictures of this blog post.

# Conclusion

Techmap is a very nice tool to have to transform single cells into something that better maps to
your chosen target. The example that I've given here is a bit dumb (I'm not even sure if it would
actually result in better compiled CXXRTL code!), but it shows some of the potential of what
can be achieved.

I have only scratched the surface of what can be done with it: there are ways to make a `techmap`
module behave differently based on whether or not certain input bits are constant, you can
instruct Yosys to run another  Yosys command after performing a `techmap` iteration, and
so forth.

If you want to go deeper, you should definitely start by checking out the help instructions, not
only of `techmap` command, but also some of the other ones.
