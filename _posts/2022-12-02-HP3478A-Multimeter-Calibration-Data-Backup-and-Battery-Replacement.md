# Introduction

Just a bit of a year ago, I wrote a blog post about 
[repairing an HP 3478A multimeter with a hacksaw](/2021/11/26/HP3478A-Multimeter-Repair-with-a-Hacksaw.html).
After posting a link on Twitter, @alex commented that I should 
[replace the RIFA capacitors](https://twitter.com/geekc64os/status/1464331326652395530?s=20&t=WQFQvTtJkUr7HXN0EoEWgg)
because they have a tendency to go up in smoke:

![Tweet about replacing RIFA capacitors](/assets/hp3478a/replace_rifa_caps_tweet.png)

The multimeter went back on the shelve, but I have now some projects in mind where I could 
use some continuous voltage recording. Now is a good time to replace the capacitors. 

Another weak spot of the 3478A is that fact that calibration parameters are stored in a voltatile 
SRAM that's permanentely powered on by a long-lasting 3V Lithium battery. There's no explicit 
production date on my unit, but a bunch of chips were produced in 1988, so after almost 34 years, I
might as well replace that one too.

There is a lot of information on the web about how to do this, though some info is
buried in long forums threads on EEVBlog or (long winded) Youtube videos. This blog post
tries to bring some of the information together.

# Replacing the Capacitors

**Unplug the power cable of the 3478A before soldering!**

There's really not a whole lot to write about the replacement process: I bought 
2 [B32021A3102K000](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/epcos-tdk-electronics/B32021A3102K000/3489458)
and 2 [B32022A3223M000](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/epcos-tdk-electronics/B32022A3223M000/1648111)
capacitors, desoldered the old ones, and replaced them.

[![Capacitors on Digikey](/assets/hp3478a/capacitors_on_digikey.png)](/assets/hp3478a/capacitors_on_digikey.png)

The 2 small RIFA caps can be found in the back, underneath the GPIB flat cable. You can
see the replacements here:

![2 small RIFA caps](/assets/hp3478a/small_rifa_caps.jpg)

The 2 large RIFA caps are underneath the power switch:

![2 large RIFA caps](/assets/hp3478a/large_rifa_caps.jpg)

In the case of the 2 smaller caps, I only had to remove unplug the flat cable and unscrew 
that gray wire. For the larger ones, I had to unscrew a larger transistor or power regulator that was
attached to the metal case, and remove 2 screws to loosen the power switch.

After that, it was the usual fiddling to desolder through-hole components. My desolder pump,
desolder wick, and desoldering needles were all useful.

The RIFA caps on my unit were in pretty decent conditions. Mine weren't completely cracked, but 
you could start to see some hairlines in the polyester. 

![Desoldered old RIFA caps](/assets/hp3478a/old_rifa_caps.jpg)

The insidious part of RIFA caps is that a part of an always-on AC mains circuit: when
the instrument is powered off but plugged in, they still can catch fire!

![RIFA caps on the schematic](/assets/hp3478a/rifa_cap_schematic.png)

It's good that they're gone now. Replacing the caps took about 45 minutes from start to finish.


# HP 3478A Calibration Data Backup, Format, and Restore

These days, a working 3478A sells for around $150 on eBay. You'll probably pay more just to have
it professionally recalibrated, or to acquire reference voltage or resistor standards if you want to
calibrate yourself, so most people will just keep using what they have. In many cases, you care more 
about measuring relative than absolute values anyway.

As mentioned earlier, the 3478A stores the calibration data in a 
[256x4 SRAM](/assets/hp3478a/uPD5101L_datasheet.pdf) that's "permanently" powered
by a lithium battery. You should definitely replace the RIFA capacitors, there's a real
fire risk when they fail, but if you don't want to replace the battery just yet, at least 
back up the calibration data so that you have a way out if you ever see the following 
message:

![3478A showing Uncalibrated message](/assets/hp3478a/uncalibrated.jpg)

There are two ways to get the calibration data:

* Use the GPIB interface to read the SRAM contents.
* Probe the SRAM pins with a logic analyzer

**Probing the SRAM pins**

![uPD5101L pinout](/assets/hp3478a/uPD5101L_pinout.png)

The uPD5105L SRAM has 22 pins, but only 20 of those are functional. Of those, you need to
probe A[7:0], DO[3:0], and some pins to determine that the microcontroller is
accessing the chip. CE2, pin 17, should do the trick.

![uPD5101L internals](/assets/hp3478a/uPD5101L_internals.png)

That's a total of 13 pins. 

Wiring up the probes is easy: the spacing of these old school DIL packages is a joy. You
do need a 16-channel logic analyzer, which are quite a bit more expensive than 
these ubiquitous $15 8-channel Saleae clones. And even if you have access to the 
[real deal](https://usd.saleae.com/products/saleae-logic-pro-16), I had the problem that... 
it didn't work: after wiring up the probes, my 3478A didn't want to boot up! 

![SRAM with probes](/assets/hp3478a/sram_with_probes.jpg)

Still, others have done it, so it's definitely possible.

**Dumping SRAM contents through the GPIB interface**

The GPIB route is much easier. I used my Agilent 82357B GPIB-to-USB dongle. Check out
my [TDS 420A control over GPIB blog post](/2020/06/27/Tektronix-TDS420A-Remote-Control-over-GPIB.html)
for details on how to install the linux-gpib kernel drivers (what a pain...).

In [a long discussion on EEVBlog](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/repair/hp-3478a-how-to-readwrite-cal-sram/), 
plenty of people post their own scripts and tools to dump the SRAM contents, but none
of them fit my needs: they were either windows-only, used Matlab, required an old version
of PyVISA, or used the linux-gpib kernel API directly.

I wanted to use the PyVISA API because it works for both Linux and Windows, so I just wrote my 
own version. 

Reading the data is straightforward: when you send a `W<addr>` GPIB message to the 3478A,
it will reply with a single character that has an ASCII value from 64 to 79. Subtract
64 from that, and you get a 4-bit value, the SRAM content of the specified address. 
Note that `<addr>` is a binary number, not the ASCII representation of the address!

*Don't worry about corrupting the calibration data with GPIB transactions: as long as 
the indent of the CAL ENABLE switch on the front panel is horizontal, it's impossible
for the microcontroller to write to the SRAM.*


In Python, the code to fetch the 256 SRAM values looks like this:

```python
def read_cal_data(hp3478a):
    cal_data = []

    for addr in range(0, 256):
        cmd = bytes([ord('W'), addr])
    
        hp3478a.write_raw(cmd)
        rvalue = ord(hp3478a.read()[0])
        assert rvalue >= 64 and rvalue < 80
        cal_data.append(rvalue-64)

    return cal_data
```

**SRAM Data Checksum**

The SRAM contents are organized as follows:

* Address 0 contains a read/write check nibble. The microcontroller does a read/write
  operation to it to check whether or not the SRAM is write protected.
* After that, there are 19 calibration entries of 13 nibbles. 

In total that's 248 SRAM values. The remaining ones are don't-care.

Each of the 19 calibration entries is organized as follows: 

* 11 nibbles with a real calibration value. 

    The first 6 nibbles specify an offset, the next 5 contain a gain.
    The coding method is a bit obscure and out of the scope of this blog post, but
    you can find the details [here](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/repair/hp-3478a-how-to-readwrite-cal-sram/msg1966463/#msg1966463).

    The same poster created [hp3478a_utils](https://github.com/fenugrec/hp3478a_utils),
    a DOS utility that decodes all the values.

    *Use the source of the utility as the 
    [golden reference](https://github.com/fenugrec/hp3478a_utils/blob/07e6311c9eb6118537e3238882c75efc8fe164d5/hp3478util.c#L230-L247): 
    later in the EEVBlog thread, there were some corner cases where the initial gain encoding 
    didn't quite work.*

* 2 nibbles that form an 8-bit checksum

    The sum of the first 11 nibbles plus the sum of the 8-bit checksum must be
    255 for a correct calibration value.

    For example:  

    ```
@@@A@IADOD@MM -> 0 0 0 1 0 9 1 4 F 4 0 D D -> 1+9+1+4+F+4+DD = 0xFF
    ```

Here's the code that checks the validity of the SRAM contents:

```python
def verify_checksum(cal_data):
    for entry in range(0,19):
        sum = 0
        for idx in range(0, 13):
            val = cal_data[entry*13 + idx + 1]
            if idx!=11:
                sum += val
            else:
                sum += val*16

        print("Checksum %2d: 0x%02x " % (entry,sum), end='')
        if sum==255:
            print(" PASS")
        else:
            print(" FAIL")
```

The 19 entries contain the calibration values for the following measurement ranges:

```
entry  0: 30 mV DC
entry  1: 300 mV DC
entry  2: 3 V DC
entry  3: 30 V DC
entry  4: 300 V DC
entry  5  Not used
entry  6: ACV
entry  7: 30 Ohm 2W/4W
entry  8: 300 Ohm 2W/4W
entry  9: 3 KOhm 2W/4W
entry 10: 30 KOhm 2W/4W
entry 11: 300 KOhm 2W/4W
entry 12: 3 MOhm 2W/4W
entry 13: 30 MOhm 2W/4W
entry 14: 300 mA DC
entry 15: 3A DC
entry 16  Not used
entry 17: 300 mA/3A AC
entry 18: Not used
```

For my unit, the checksum of unused entries 5, 16 and 18 still matched, but that's
not generally true. When a checksum doesn't match for a given measurement range, the
LCD display will show "CAL" to indicate that this particular range is in need of recalibration.

**Restoring SRAM contents**

You can restore the SRAM data by writing `X<addr><data>` over the GPIB interface.
Like the "W" command, both addr and data are formatted as raw 8-bit numbers.
Only the lower 4 bits of data are written to the SRAM.

```python
def write_cal_data(hp3478a, cal_data):
    for addr in range(0, 256):
        cmd = bytes([ord('X'), addr, cal_data[addr] ])
        hp3478a.write_raw(cmd)
```

The code above won't work when the CAL ENABLE switch on the front panel is switched
to OFF. 

**Pulling everything together**

The full scripts to fetch and restore calibration data can be found 
[here](https://github.com/tomverbeure/hp3478a_calibration).

This is the output of `hp3478a_read_calibration.py` of my unit:

# Replacement 3V Battery 

The battery in the 3478A is not socketed but soldered straight on the PCB, with contacts
spot welded the plus and the minus terminals.

![Spot welded battery](/assets/hp3478a/spot_welded_battery.jpg)

The schematic and PCB list a 3V battery, but as far as I can tell, all batteries start out
higher, with the voltage dropping as the battery charge goes down. In my case, the voltage was at
3.03V.

Digikey sells the [BR-2/3AE5SPN battery](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/panasonic-bsg/BR-2-3AE5SPN/61161),
with spot welded contacts:

![BR-2/3AE5SPN battery](/assets/hp3478a/br-23ae5spn.png)

An alternative is to use a battery with wires, as in [this Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-itiJSftzs). 
It has the benefit of being able to wrap the battery in a plastic so that battery leaks won't destroy the PCB, 
but then you need a way to fix the battery in place somewhere. 

![battery with wires](/assets/hp3478a/battery_with_wires.png)

**Important! Don't follow the instructions of that Youtube video about how to connect a temporary battery
in parallel: he's doing it wrong!**

I mistakenly ordered the BR-2/3A battery without the through-hole pins. Luckily, I have one of those $40 spot
welders and was able to attach the pins myself. 

![Custom spot welded battery](/assets/hp3478a/custom_battery.jpg)

# SRAM Power Circuit

Let's have a look at the [service manual](/assets/hp3478a/hp-3478a-Service.pdf) and check out how
the SRAM is powered.

![schematic of battery circuit](/assets/hp3478a/battery_circuit.png)

On page 156, marked in green, you can see the battery itself (BT701), a resistor and a diode. I don't quite
understand why you'd put a resistor in series with a battery, but when the main power is switched
off, there's no resistive path to ground, so it shouldn't matter, especially when the standby current of
the SRAM is only 10uA:

![SRAM standby current](/assets/hp3478a/uPD5101L_standby_current.png)

The diode is important though: it prevents current from going from the 5V rail to the 3V battery
when the main power is switched on.

Meanwhile, on page 154, the SRAM itself is U512. Once again, you can see the power supply area in green.
*Unrelated, but in red, you can see how the CAL ENABLE switch forces the `R/W` pin of the SRAM permanently to `R` when
the switch is open.*

![schematic of calibration RAM logic](/assets/hp3478a/calibration_ram.png)

We can see another diode, this time between the SRAM and the +5V supply. This diode
prevents current flowing from the 3V battery to 5V power rail when the main power is off.

When you pull everything together, the schematic looks like this:

![SRAM power schematic](/assets/hp3478a/sram_power_schematic.png)

This is all very conventional.

# Swapping the Battery

If you want to swap the battery with a new one, these are your options:

* The obvious way: back up calibration data. Unplug the power cable. Desolder old battery. 
  Solder new battery. Restore calibration data.

    **Unplug the power cable of the 3478A before soldering!**

    With his method, you need that GPIB interface to read and write the calibration data.

    Or do you? 

    I went this route **and didn't need to restore the calibration data!** I've seen similar reports
    online. I'm speculating that there's sufficient charge in capacitor C510 to keep the SRAM from
    losing its contents. After all, there's really nothing else to discharge that capacitor.

* The dangerous way: replace the battery while the whole device is switched on.

    This way, the 5V power rail stays on as well and the SRAM won't lose its contents. 

    This method is dangerous for 2 reasons: you'll be soldering on a device with active 110V or
    220V AC. For me, that reason enough to not consider this option.

    Another issue is that the heating tip of almost all soldering irons is connected to ground. When
    the multimeter is plugged in as well, this could result in a short when you accidentally touch
    some random contacts. So you have use an iron that isn't plugged into a regular power socket: 
    there are butane powered irons, or you could use one that's powered by a USB power bank.

    But really, just don't do it...

* The intermediate way: use an additional, temporary 3V battery to keep the SRAM powered on.

    **Unplug the power cable of the 3478A before soldering!**

    This the way to go if you don't have a GPIB interface.

    Put 2 AA or AAA batteries in a dual battery cage to create an additional 3V, add a third diode,
    and temporarily(!) solder it to PCB.

    The schematic of the updated contraption looks like this:

    ![circuit with extra battery](/assets/hp3478a/extra_battery_circuit.png)

    The SRAM only needs 2V for data retention while in standby mode, so any diode with a forward
    voltage of less than 1V should work. If you don't have one in your toolbox,
    just add a few $0.10 [1N4148 diodes](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/onsemi/1N4148/458603) to 
    your Digikey shopping list. 

    There are plenty of places to solder the ground. The easiest place to solder the cathode
    of the new diode is at the cathode of CR500:
