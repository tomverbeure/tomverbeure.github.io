    This file contains instructions for loading the 16500B fonts onto a
    HP-UX or other unix(r) workstation.  The same fonts can be used with
    X server packages on PC's. However, the method for installing the fonts
    on different PC X servers will vary by the vendor, so check with your
    X documentation for details and instructions.
     

    TO LOAD THE FONTS FOR USE ON A UNIX SYSTEM:

    1. Move the files lg165.bdf and sm165.bdf from their location on the
       16500B hard disk (in directory /system) to a desired directory
       on your Unix system.
    2. Cd to that directory, and do a "mkfontdir" command.
    3. Type "xset +fp <dir>", where <dir> is the full path of your font dir.
    4. Type "xset fp rehash".


    That's all there is to it.  Steps (3) and (4) will need to be repeated
    each time that X11 is restarted.  To overcome this, simply install the 
    fonts as directed in your X11 font directory, typically found in:
     
                  /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc

    This directory is usually protected so this will require action from 
    your system administrator.
