The frequency sweep setup isn't exactly intuitive.  See the pull-out card for some useful information.

      Note:  frequency sweep is mostly "digital" - e.g. the synthesizer is stepped in frequency a number of 
      times to cover the specified "span".   The span, frequency step size, and "dwell time" at each step is 
      programmable.

1.  Some "Special Functions" can be used to set operational parameters.
	Example:  the dwell time at each frequency step is set by Special Functions 40 through 44.
	
2.  Basic Sweep Setup
	a)  Set the Center Frequency in the same way frequency is specified in CW mode.  
	      e.g. press the FREQ key in the FUNCTION panel, then enter the frequency and finish with the 
	      appropriate units key.  (KHz, MHz, etc.)
	b)  In the FUNCTION panel, sweep parameters are shown in Red text.  
	     To select a sweep parameter to set, press the SHIFT button followed by the button associated with
	      "Swp Width" or "Swp Incr" button.
	c)  After the function is selected, specify the data using the keypad in the DATA panel.
	     First, key in the numeric data and then complete entry by pressing the appropriate key in
	     the UNITS panel.  
	            Process:
		Press   SHIFT key
		Press   Swp Width key or Swp Incr key 
		Press   Data keys 
		Press   Units key
	      Both parameters should be set after power up. (?)
	d)  The "dwell time" (duration of each frequency step in the sweep) is controlled by two keys
	      in the SWEEP panel (above the output connector) or AUTO can be selected.  
	      Selecting AUTO should start the sweep using a default dwell time.  =====================> START SWEEP

	     To set the dwell time to one of the 5 built-in values specified by a Special Function code,  
	      determine the desired two digit code (e.g. 41) from the pull-out card.  Enter the code by:
	             Process:
		Press the SHIFT key in the FUNCTION panel
		Enter the two digit code in the DATA panel 
	e)  Finish entry and start the sweep when a Special Function is used by pressing the SLOW key in the 
	     SWEEP panel.  The sweep should start.		            =====================> START SWEEP

	Once sweeping, it appears that the parameters can be adjusted as needed.
